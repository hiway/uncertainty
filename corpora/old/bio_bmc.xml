Extraction (IE) is a component of text mining that facilitates knowledge discovery by automatically locating instances of interesting biomedical events from huge document

important.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">Corpora annotated with information concerning this behaviour <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> constitute a valuable resource in the training of IE components and resources.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.7">Results</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.8">We have defined a new scheme for annotating sentence-bound gene regulation events, centred on both verbs and nominalised verbs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.9">For each event instance, all participants

Gene Regulation Ontology.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.10">To our knowledge, our scheme is unique within the biomedical field in terms of the range of event arguments identified.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.11">Using the scheme, we have created the Gene Regulation Event Corpus (GREC), consisting of 240 MEDLINE abstracts, in which events relating to gene regulation and expression have been annotated by biologists.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.12">A novel method of evaluating various different facets of the annotation task showed that average inter-annotator agreement rates fall within the range of 66% - 90%.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.13">Conclusion</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.14">The GREC is a unique resource within the biomedical field, in that it annotates not only core relationships between entities, but also a range of other important details about these relationships, e.g., location, temporal, manner and environmental conditions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">As such, it is specifically designed to support bio-specific tool and resource development.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">It has already been used to acquire semantic frames for inclusion within the BioLexicon (a lexical, terminological resource to aid biomedical text mining).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">Initial experiments have also shown that the corpus <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> viably be used to train IE components, such as semantic role labellers.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">The corpus and annotation guidelines are freely available for academic purposes.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.19">Background</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.20">Due to the rapid advances in biomedical research, scientific literature is being published at an ever-increasing rate [1].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">Without automated means, it is difficult for researchers to keep abreast of developments within biomedicine [2-6].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Text mining, which is receiving increasing interest within the biomedical field [7,8], enriches text via the addition of semantic metadata, and thus permits tasks such as analysing molecular pathways [9] and semantic searching.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Semantic searching above the level of concepts depends on prior processing to recognise relations or events in texts, which is carried out by information extraction (IE) systems.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">Due to domain-specific features of texts and the types of events to be recognised, IE systems must be adapted to deal with specific domains.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">A well-established method of carrying out this adaptation is through training using annotated corpora (e.g., [10-12]).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">Our work has been concerned with the development of such a corpus for the biomedical field, the Gene Regulation Event Corpus (GREC), consisting of MEDLINE abstracts semantically annotated with event information.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">Our approach is based on the fact that many events are focussed on either verbs (e.g., transcribe, regulate) or nominalised verbs (e.g., transcription, regulation).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">Both types of word behave in similar ways, in that they specify arguments that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> convey a range of different types of information related to the event.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">For each relevant event, our annotation aims to identify, as exhaustively as possible, all structurally-related arguments within the same sentence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Each argument is assigned a semantic role from a fixed set of 13 roles.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Where appropriate, arguments are also assigned a biological concept type.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">The GREC may be downloaded from http://www.nactem.ac.uk/GREC/.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">A copy of the corpus is also available in Additional file 1.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">To our knowledge, the GREC provides the richest annotation to date within the biomedical field, in terms of the number of arguments types and their characterisation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">As such, the corpus is specifically designed to contribute to the development of bio-specific semantic frame resources and semantic role labellers (SRLs) which, although active areas of research within the general language domain, have received less attention within the bio-IE domain.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.36">Related work</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.37">Within the field of bio-IE, evaluations such as the LLL05 challenge [13] and BioCreative II [14] have focussed attention on the recognition of protein-protein interaction (PPI) events from the literature.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">There now exists a number of corpora (e.g., [13,15,16]) and systems (e.g., [17-19]) tailored to this task.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">However, many other types of events and information are relevant within biomedicine, such as gene regulation and expression events, location of protein in the cell, protein-DNA interaction, etc. [20].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">Extraction of such events often requires the recognition of more complex information than just interacting proteins.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">Several corpora and systems concerned with the annotation of more complex events have recently been developed, e.g., [21-24].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">These differ in a number of ways, including:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">• Range of events - <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> a single type of event <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> multiple event types are annotated.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">• Event arguments - the number and types of arguments (i.e., participants) in each event <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be fixed <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> flexible.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">More detailed information types, e.g., location, time or experimental setup <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may or may not</ccue> be identified as event arguments.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">• Scope of events - <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> event arguments must occur within a single sentence <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> they <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> occur across multiple sentences.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">• Semantic information assigned to arguments - this <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> correspond to named entity types and/or semantic roles.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">In the case of semantic roles being assigned, they <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be tailored to a particular type of event, or they <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> apply to a large range of different events.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">Whilst events are often identified by verbs, nominalised verbs play a particularly important role within biomedical texts, and often outnumber other domain-specific verbal forms [25].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">However, it is acknowledged that they are more difficult to process than verbs [26] and are currently only dealt with by a small number of systems, often in a limited way (e.g., [17,27,28]).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">Due to the central nature of verbs and nominalised verbs in the description of events, accurate event extraction requires information about the way they behave in text, in terms of:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.52">• Their syntactically-related arguments, e.g. causality, location, manner, etc.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.53">• Semantic information relating to each argument (e.g., semantic roles or restrictions on the types of phrase that can constitute each argument).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.54">The production of corpora annotated with such information allows real usage within text to be taken into account.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.55">Large-scale annotation of corpora within the general language domain at this level of detail has resulted in the production of resources containing syntactic and semantic frame information, which deal with both verbs and nominalised verbs [29-32].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.56">Such annotated corpora also facilitate the training of components of IE systems, with a large amount of research having been devoted to semantic role labelling (SRL) [33].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.57">Some studies (e.g., [34,35]) have shown that, to a certain extent, general language resources <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> also be useful in the training of SRLs for biomedical texts, due to the fact that many verbs appear in texts from both the general language and biomedical domains, and often behave in similar ways.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.58">However, the cited works concede that, whilst such SRLs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> produce adequate results for certain predicates, training using biomedical corpora is also needed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.59">This is because domains such as biomedicine employ sublanguages [36], in which the "informational content and structure form a specialized language that can be delineated in the form of a sublanguage grammar".</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.60">NLP systems must take such grammars into account to allow accurate processing of text within specialist domains [37].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.61">Sublanguage grammar features that are relevant to our work include the following:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.62">• The types of events found in biological sciences are often described using verbs/nominalised verbs that do not feature prominently in general language [26], e.g., methylate.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.63">• Verbs/nominalised verbs that occur in both the general and specialised language domains <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> have different syntactic and semantic properties in each domain, e.g., differing numbers of arguments [38], as well as different meanings.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.64">For example, translation generally means rendering one language into other, while in Molecular Biology it specifies the process of protein synthesis from an mRNA template.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.65">Whilst there have been some attempts to produce bio-specific extensions to the general language resources described above, e.g., [38,39], together with semantic role labellers [20,40], they currently have limited coverage.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.66">The UMLS SPECIALIST lexicon [41], which includes many biomedical terms, is larger scale, but includes only syntactic, and not semantic, information about verbs.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.67">Motivation</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.68">Existing event corpora within the domain (e.g., [21] and [23]) are not specifically geared to support the acquisition of semantic frame information for verbs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.69">The bio-NLP community has, until now, lacked a domain-specific linguistically-oriented corpus in which detailed semantic information for a wide range of both verbs and nominalised verbs has been annotated.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.70">This has limited the amount of research undertaken on the production of domain-specific semantic frame resources and SRLs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.71">In response to this, we have designed a new event annotation scheme which is specifically tailored to this purpose.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.72">The scheme has subsequently been applied to the annotation of event instances relating to gene regulation and expression in MEDLINE abstracts.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.73">Our scheme differs from those of previous event corpora in the field in a number of important ways:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.74">• It captures the semantic annotation of as many structurally-related arguments as possible of a large number of verbs and nominalised verbs describing gene regulation and expression events.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.75">This is important since, according to [20], and as confirmed by us through consultation with biologists, types of information such as location, manner, timing and condition, which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> appear in various syntactic positions, are all essential for describing biomedical relations.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.76">A sentence-based approach facilitates the linking between semantic information and syntactic structure.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.77">• It bridges linguistic and biological knowledge:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.78">From the linguistic perspective, all arguments are characterised using semantic roles.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.79">We have defined a new, closed set of event-independent roles which are designed for application to arguments of a range of types of biomedical events.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.80">Closed sets of semantic roles are advantageous in that they facilitate generalization over different types of events [25,42].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.81">Although their application to general language <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be problematic [30], the use of a closed set is viable in a restricted domain, as domain-specific definitions <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be provided for each semantic role type.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.82">From the biological perspective, appropriate arguments are additionally assigned a biological concept type from a hierarchically-structured set that is tailored to the gene regulation domain.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.83">The concepts are mapped to classes in the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) [43].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.84">The combination of semantic role and biological concept labels provides a rich annotation, aimed at allowing users to have a large amount of flexibility over the type of query they specify and to have control over the specificity or generality of certain parts of the query, e.g.:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.85">In LOCATION:E. coli, AGENT:NifA activates which THEME:GENE.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.86">This query would search for instances of events in which a LOCATION, AGENT and THEME are specified.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.87">The values of the semantic roles <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be specified <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">either</ccue> as specific words or phrases (e.g., E. coli or NifA) <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> more general named entity categories (e.g., GENE).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.88">The GREC consists of 240 MEDLINE abstracts, which have been annotated with a total of 3067 events.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.89">Whilst of modest size compared to some other domain-specific event-annotated corpora (e.g., [21]), this is balanced by the richness of the annotations.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.90">The corpus has already been used in the development of the BioLexicon [44].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.91">This unique text mining resource for biology provides and links syntactic and semantic frame information for a large number of biomedical sublanguage verbs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.92">In addition, the lexicon contains (1) derived forms of these verbs (including nominalisations), (2) general English words frequently used within the biology domain and (3) domain terms, gathered (and interlinked) both from existing databases and through the application of text mining techniques.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.93">Initial machine learning experiments using the GREC [45] <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that it <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be used to train IE components with reasonably good performance, with both named entity extraction and semantic role labelling having achieved F-scores of around 60%, based on 10-fold cross validation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.94">A further direction of research which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> help to improve the performance of IE systems trained on the GREC is introduced in [46], in which it is demonstrated that, due to the differing perspectives of different annotation schemes, it is not always the case that larger corpora contain the most useful information.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.95">The reported study found that, whilst small corpora <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> not be large enough to train IE systems in their own right, augmenting such corpora with training instances derived from other corpora <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> help to improve the performance of the trained system.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.96">This provides convincing evidence that combining smaller, richly annotated corpora, such as our own, with larger corpora which are slightly poorer in information content, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> provide a future direction of research for training more accurate biomedical IE systems.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.97">This idea is especially attractive, given that the production of large, richly annotated corpora <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be very time consuming.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.98">In the remainder of this paper, we firstly cover the key aspects of our annotation scheme, followed by a description of the recruitment and training of annotators.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.99">We follow this by providing detailed statistics, results and evaluation of the GREC, and finally present some conclusions and directions for further research.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.100">Methods</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.101">This section is concerned with the preparatory work required prior to the annotation of the GREC.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.102">Beginning with a clarification of our notion of an event, we then provide a description of the key features of our annotation scheme.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.103">A brief overview of the annotation software used and of its customisation is followed by details regarding the annotators and their training.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.104">As performance during training was measured quantitively through the calculation of inter-annotator agreement (IAA) scores following each cycle of training, we provide details and motivation for our chosen evaluation metric, the F-measure.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.105">Finally, we provide an analysis of the IAA results attained during training.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.106">Events in biomedical texts</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.107">In this section, we clarify our notion of an event.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.108">Firstly, we provide some simple examples of event instances that relate to gene regulation and expression within biomedical texts:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.109">1) In Escherichia Coli, glnAP2 <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be activated by NifA.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.110">2) Our results show that glnA encodes glutamine synthetase.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.111">For each event, two types of information <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be specified in the text, both of which are important to its correct interpretation:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.112">• The participants (or arguments) of the event.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.113">In sentence 1), there are 3 arguments specified by the verb activated, i.e., In Escherichia Coli, glnAP2 and NifA.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.114">• Higher level information (called modality) about how the event should be interpreted.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.115">For example, the word may in sentence 1) indicates that there is some uncertainty about the truth of the event, whilst the phrase Our results show that in 2) indicates that there is experimental evidence to back up the event described by encodes.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.116">Several recent articles (e.g., [47-51]) have reported on attempts to annotate information such as certainty, evidence or negation within biomedical texts.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.117">Our current work concerns the first of these information types.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.118">Specifically, the annotation task consists of the following, in sequence:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.119">a) Identifying relevant instances of events that relate to gene regulation and expression.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.120">b) Identifying all arguments of the event that are specified within the same sentence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.121">c) Finally, assigning semantic roles and biological concepts to these arguments.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.122">Table 1 illustrates the type of information that would be annotated for sentences 1) and 2) above.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="TableLegend"><Sentence id="S1.123">Example annotation output</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.124">Annotation scheme</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.125">In this section, we outline some key aspects of the annotation scheme.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.126">Firstly, we describe the types of events on which the annotation is focussed, i.e., gene regulation and expression.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.127">This is followed by a more detailed description of the semantic roles and biological concepts assigned to event arguments.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.128">Finally, we provide an account of some of the steps taken to ensure the consistency of annotated text spans.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.129">To accompany the annotation scheme, we have produced a detailed set of annotation guidelines, as these are necessary to aid in the achievement of high quality annotations [52-54].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.130">The structure and content of these guidelines were iteratively refined in discussion with domain experts and with annotators (via group discussion sessions following annotation training phrases and full annotation cycles).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.131">The guidelines are available to download from http://www.nactem.ac.uk/GREC/, and are also available in Additional file 1.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.132">Gene regulation and expression events</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.133">The current annotation effort is concerned with events relating only to gene regulation or expression, i.e., events that describe any interaction which leads, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">either</ccue> directly <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> indirectly, to the production of a protein.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.134">Annotation is restricted to sentences that contain some mechanical description of transcription, translation or post-transcriptional modifications and/or their controls.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.135">Annotators were helped by (but not restricted to) a list of verbs which we created that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">potentially</ccue> denote gene regulation and expression events.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.136">These are automatically highlighted by the annotation software, WordFreak (see Software section below), in each abstract to be annotated.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.137">The basis of this list was a set of 229 hand-picked gene regulation verbs provided by the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.138">We augmented this list through the automatic extraction of further verbs from an E. coli corpus.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.139">This corpus contains approximately 33,000 MEDLINE abstracts and was also provided by EMBL-EBI.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.140">The automatic extraction was carried out by identifying those verbs whose syntactic arguments corresponded <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">either</ccue> to terms identified by the TerMine tool (http://www.nactem.ac.uk/software/termine/)<ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> biological named entities identified by the GENIA tagger [55].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.141">The complete list was subsequently reviewed for relevance by a biology expert, resulting in a list of 353 verbs.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.142">Semantic roles</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.143">Starting with the generic semantic roles proposed for VerbNet [29] and PropBank [30], we examined a large number of relevant events within MEDLINE abstracts, in consultation with biologists.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.144">We concluded that arguments of gene regulation and expression events <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be characterised using a subset of these general language roles, with the addition of the domain-specific CONDITION role.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.145">In some cases, we changed the names of the roles used in other resources in an attempt to make them more easily understandable to biologist annotators.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.146">From VerbNet, we have used the roles AGENT, THEME, INSTRUMENT, LOCATION, SOURCE and DESTINATION.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.147">Our RATE and TEMPORAL roles are based on the VerbNet EXTENT and TIME roles, respectively.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.148">MANNER and PURPOSE come from PropBank's set of general roles that are applicable to any verb.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.149">We also saw a need for a role similar to the VerbNet PREDICATE role, to deal with cases such as:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.150">The (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex functions as an activator..., where an activator corresponds to the PREDICATE role of functions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.151">For our own purposes, we created 2 separate roles, DESCRIPTIVE-AGENT and DESCRIPTIVE-THEME, and extended the characterisation of these roles to apply not only to predicatives, but also to any argument which describes characteristics or behaviour of <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">either</ccue> the AGENT <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> the THEME of the event.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.152">The full set of roles is shown in Table 2.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.153">In general, definitions of argument types normally specified as adjuncts, such as MANNER, INSTRUMENT, CONDITION and LOCATION, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be problematic to distinguish from each other.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.154">However, our use of more biologically-oriented definitions for these cases aims to reduce discrepancies.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="TableLegend"><Sentence id="S1.155">Semantic roles</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.156">Biological concepts</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.157">Our biological concept labels are organised into hierarchies based on the Gene Regulation Ontology (GRO) [43].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.158">This ontology, which integrates and builds on parts of other established bio-ontologies, such as Gene Ontology [56] and Sequence Ontology [57], is also included within the list of ontologies of the OBO Foundry [58].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.159">Our biological concept labels are arranged within 5 different hierarchies, corresponding to the following supercategories: Nucleic_Acids, Proteins, Living_Systems, Processes and Experimental.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.160">During annotation, biological concepts are identified within each semantic argument.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.161">In each case, the most specific concept category possible within the appropriate hierarchy is assigned, based on the context in which the concept occurs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.162">The aim of this is to allow queries over extracted event instances to be performed at different levels of granularity, i.e., users <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> specify more general or less general concept types according to their requirements.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.163">Consider the following example:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.164">To map the regulatory domain of Escherichia coli T-protein...</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.165">Here, it is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue> to assign the specific concept category Domain (within the Proteins hierarchy) to the concept the regulatory domain, which is a functional part of a protein.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.166">However, the following example presents a greater challenge:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.167">IHF <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> inhibit ompF transcription by altering how OmpR interacts with the ompF promoter.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.168">Here, IHF is clearly a repressor.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.169">However, the specific category of OmpR is ambiguous from the context of the sentence between:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.170">• An activator of the ompF promoter.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.171">• A repressor of the ompF promoter.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.172">Therefore, the more general category of Regulator is assigned to OmpR.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.173">Consistent annotation of text spans</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.174">The task of annotating consistent text spans is often challenging [52], but is important to ensure a cleanly annotated corpus which is easy to understand, reuse and process.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.175">Consider the following sentence:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.176">The Klebsiella rcsA gene encoded a polypeptide of 23 kDa</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.177">The AGENT of encoded <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic

promote consistent choice of spans, we have created a number of guidelines which are mostly based on syntactic chunks.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.180">Prior to annotation, chunks are automatically identified by the GENIA tagger [55].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.181">The example below illustrates the output of the tagger, in terms of the chunks identified.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.182">Note

polypeptide ] [PP of ] [NP 23 kDa]</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.184">According to our guidelines, annotated text spans should normally consist of (sequences of) complete chunks, thus alleviating many issues relating to the exact words that should be included within an argument text span.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.185">This means that, for example, in the above sentence, the AGENT of encoded should be chosen as The Klebsiella rcsA gene, as this corresponds to a complete NP chunk.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.186">A further guideline stipulates that argument text spans must consist only of base NP chunks, and that additional descriptive information, usually introduced by prepositions, must be excluded from argument text spans.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.187">In the above sentence, application of this rule means that the THEME of encoded is only the chunk a polypeptide, whilst of 23 kDa is excluded from the argument text span.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart

a number of ways.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.193">For example, occurrences of biologically-relevant verbs are automatically highlighted.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.194">In addition, colour-coding is used to distinguish different types of chunks, whilst certain restrictions are imposed in the tool as regards the types of chunks that can constitute different types of semantic arguments, e.g., ADVP

type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.196">Due to the requirement for biological knowledge and complete understanding of the abstracts, annotation was undertaken by 6 biology PhD students with native or near-native competency in English.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.197">It was also required that annotators had at least some experience in gene regulation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.198">Linguistic expertise would be acquired through the training programme and through study of the annotation guidelines.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.199">As the annotation was carried out as part of the EC BOOTStrep project (http://www.bootstrep.org), it was subject to strict time constraints, with the amount of time to complete the annotation work being limited to three months.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.200">This time constraint firstly meant that we were unable to recruit annotators who all had a similarly high level of knowledge of gene regulation and expression.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.201">In addition, due to the envisaged steep learning curve for annotators, it was decided to devote the majority of the time available to annotator training.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.202">The employment of 6 annotators, however, allowed a medium-sized final GREC to be annotated in a relatively short space of time.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.203">Initial training sessions introduced the annotation tool and the task, with a particular emphasis being placed on clear positive and negative examples of gene regulation and expression events.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.204">This was considered particularly important for those annotators with less experience in gene regulation and expression.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.205">The initial training sessions were followed up by 5 fortnightly cycles, during which abstracts were firstly annotated by the annotators and then examined by 2 of the authors (one with biological expertise and the other with linguistic expertise), who produced individual feedback reports for each annotator prior to the start of the next cycle of annotation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.206">Additional regular group sessions allowed problems to be discussed in more detail.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.207">The calculation of IAA scores after each training cycle provided a quantitative measure of improvement during the training

id="S1.209">Calculating inter-annotator agreement</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.210">We have defined a novel evaluation methodology which calculates IAA for a number of separate subtasks of the annotation process.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.211">These subtasks are as follows:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.212">• Event identification (how frequently annotators agree on which events to annotate).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.213">• Argument identification (for agreed events, how frequently the same arguments are chosen by each annotator).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.214">For this task, we calculate separate agreement rates corresponding to:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.215">a. Relaxed span matches, where argument text spans identified by a pair of annotators at least overlap with each other, but do not necessarily match exactly.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.216">b. Exact span matches, where argument text spans identified by a pair of annotators match exactly.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.217">This statistic helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of our rules for consistent span annotation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.218">• Semantic role assignment (for agreed arguments, how often the same semantic roles are assigned by each annotator).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.219">• Biological concept identification (within agreed arguments, how often annotators identify the same biological concepts).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.220">• Biological concept category assignment (for agreed biological concepts, how often the assigned categories are agreed upon by each annotator).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.221">For this task, we calculate 3 different agreement rates, i.e.,</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.222">a. Exact category matches, where each annotator has assigned exactly the same concept label.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.223">b. Matches including parent, where we also consider as matches those cases where the category assigned by one annotator is the parent concept of the category assigned by the other annotator.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.224">c. Supercategory assignment, where we consider only <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> each annotator has assigned a concept within the same top level superclass, i.e., Nucleic_Acids, Proteins, Living_Systems, Processes and Experimental.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.225">Whilst the Kappa statistic [60] has become a standard way of calculating IAA for classification tasks, it is problematic for most of the annotation subtasks outlined above, as it requires classifications to correspond to mutually exclusive and discrete categories.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.226">The only subtask which fits neatly into this category is the semantic role assignment subtask.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.227">We have thus chosen to follow [61] in choosing the F-Score to calculate IAA, as it can be applied straightforwardly to all of the above annotation subtasks.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.228">The F-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall scores, which are normally calculated to compare the performance of an information retrieval or extraction system to a gold standard.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.229">For the purposes of calculating IAA, precision and recall between two annotators can be calculated by treating one set of annotations as the gold standard.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.230">The F-score is the same whichever set of annotations is used as the gold standard [62].</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.231">Agreement during training</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart

levels falling in the range 70% - 90%, which we consider to be acceptable [47].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.239">When the species referred to in the abstract was changed (from E. coli to human), this resulted in a drop in agreement rates for most tasks, particularly bio-concept assignment, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that a period of adjustment is required when switching to a new species.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.240">Two tasks, however, i.e., semantic role assignment and argument identification, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">seem</ccue> more domain-independent, in that the agreement rates stayed constant, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> even continued to rise slightly, when the species referred to in the text was changed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.241">The main exception to the general trend for improvement is in the assignment of biological concept categories, for which there was no discernible improvement during the training period.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.242">Differing levels of experience in gene regulation <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> have caused annotators to vary in their ability to accurately assign fine-grained biological concept categories.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.243">However, higher levels of agreement are achieved <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition

id="S1.13">Conclusion</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.14">Collectively, mzAPI and multiplierz facilitate a wide range of data analysis tasks, spanning technology development to biological annotation, for mass spectrometry-based proteomics research.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.15">Background</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.16">Mass spectrometry-based proteomics, particularly liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization, has become the predominant technique for identification and quantification of proteins in biological systems [1].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">Growing demand for improved annotation of primary proteomics data with biological information from various public databases has catalyzed interest in the development of software tools to support integration of these data types.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">Unfortunately, a number of factors, including lack of experimental standardization, rapid introduction of novel mass spectrometry technology, and the evolution of proprietary file formats associated with proteomics platforms represent a significant hurdle to the development of efficient and comprehensive software frameworks.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">To accommodate the emergent nature of proteomics-related technologies and the burgeoning number of databases that contain various biological annotations, data analytic systems must emphasize (i) intuitive and interactive interfaces, (ii) user-accessible coding frameworks to facilitate rapid prototyping of algorithms, and (iii) customizable sets of tools that can be readily integrated to provide pipelines that support a variety of proteomic workflows.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">Task specific Windows desktop applications such as MSQuant [2] and InsilicosViewer [3] can access a subset of native mass spectrometry data files directly and provide flexibility through adjustable parameters, but are not readily extended across the full spectrum of data analytic activities required in modern proteomics research.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">To address the full spectrum of analyses, open source projects such as The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline (TOPP) [4] and ProteoWizard [5] offer a set of modular tools for generation of pipelines.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">The C++ coding environment of these tools is designed for performance and throughput, although researchers who lack programming experience often struggle to implement novel algorithms or other ad hoc tasks.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Therefore, software libraries such as InSilicoSpectro [6] and mspire [7] have been developed based on high-level languages such as Perl and Ruby respectively.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">These libraries allow scripting of common data analysis tasks but cannot access raw binary data directly, and must rely instead on surrogate text files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">Historically the proprietary nature of binary files associated with proteomics technologies represented a significant obstacle to efforts aimed at development of integrated, desktop environments.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">One solution proposed specifically for mass spectrometry is extraction of native data to a common file format, typically a dialect of XML [8,9].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">We [10] and others [11] have challenged the technical merits of this approach.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">Given that mass spectrometry manufacturers implicitly carry the burden of maintaining up-to-date libraries for access to their native data, we recently proposed that a common API [10] is a more rational solution for shared access to proprietary mass spectrometry files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Here we define and implement a minimal API (mzAPI) that provides direct, programmatic interaction with binary raw files and we demonstrate that performance for practical tasks is significantly faster as compared to equivalent operations for access to mzXML files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">We implement mzAPI in Python to maximize accessibility; similarly, mzAPI is exposed to users through multiplierz, a Python-based desktop environment that combines an intuitive interface with a powerful and flexible high-level scripting platform.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Together, mzAPI and multiplierz support a wide range of data analytic tasks and facilitate rapid prototyping of novel algorithms.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">In addition, the multiplierz environment is designed with a "zero-infrastructure" philosophy, meaning that it can be deployed by end users who lack system administration experience or support.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">We demonstrate the capabilities of multiplierz through a variety of proteomics case studies such as (i) label-free quantitative comparison and interactive validation of datasets from multi-acquisition experiments, (ii) automatic quality control of mass spectrometer performance, (iii) improved peptide sequence assignment via deisotoping of MS/MS spectra, and (iv) assessment of phosphopeptide enrichment efficiency through programmatic fragment ion extraction.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart

Formats</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.36">As described above, direct access to native mass spectrometry data files is a key factor in the assembly of a powerful and flexible framework for proteomics data analysis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">Towards this end, we define a minimal mzAPI as consisting of the following key procedures:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">1. scan(time) › [(mz, intensity)]</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">2. scan_list(start_time, stop_time) › [(time, precursor)]</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">3. time_range() › (start_time, stop_time)</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">4. scan_time_from_scan_name (scan_name) › time</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">5. ric(start_time, stop_time, start_mz, stop_mz) › [(time, intensity)]</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">The first two procedures in mzAPI return: 1) individual scans in the form of a list of (mz, intensity) pairs, and 2) a catalog of all scan descriptions in the form of a list of (time, precursor) pairs in the experiment.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">In addition, the API provides: 3) 'time_range' that returns the earliest and latest acquisition times in the experiment, and 4) 'scan_time_from_scan_name' for translation of manufacturer-specific scan nomenclature to the mzAPI naming convention.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">We opted to rely on acquisition time as a common naming convention.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">In the case of LC-MS this is equivalent to chromatographic retention time.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">Finally, a fifth procedure generates a reconstructed ion chromatogram (RIC) for a given time and mass-to-charge range, returned as a set of (time, intensity) pairs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">While in principle RICs can be generated using the first two calls, we <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">believe</ccue> that ubiquitous use of the RIC operation in proteomics data analysis justifies exposure of RIC extraction as a primitive in the API.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">Given that RIC extraction is provided by all manufacturer libraries, this procedure represents an excellent example of efficient re-use of native data system indexing and software.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">We <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">propose</ccue> that a proprietary file format is considered mzAPI compliant when the manufacturer provides a freely available, and preferably redistributable, implementation of the aforementioned 5 core procedures, or an extended version that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> evolve from a community-driven standardization effort.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">For example, ThermoFisher Scientific provides a data access library for .RAW files through the MSFileReader program, freely available for download at: http://sjsupport.thermofinnigan.com/public/detail.asp?id=586 or http://blais.dfci.harvard.edu/research/mass-informatics/mzAPI/vendor-libraries/.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.52">Naturally, additional procedure calls, such as charge state or signal-to-noise values for each isotope cluster in MS or MS/MS scans, can be incorporated into the mzAPI framework by essentially subclassing the core mzFile class.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.53">As a basic test of file access speed, we compared the time required for random access of scans in an LC-MS acquisition from a ThermoFisher .RAW file using mzAPI (through its Python implementation) versus libraries provided by the manufacturer and included in the native Xcalibur file browser (note that mzXML data was not considered for this comparison since it does not provide access by acquisition time as a primitive in the RAP or RAMP API).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.54">Table 1 demonstrates that, as expected, random file access via mzAPI is slower than that obtained when working directly in the manufacturer's native environment.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.55">The performance of the common API <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> be further improved by implementation in C++ or C#, but we explicitly chose Python to maintain maximum flexibility through user defined scripts (see below).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.56">Interestingly, one consequence of the common API strategy is that it provides a direct measure of manufacturer data system efficiency, as evidenced by the additional time required for random access to scans in .WIFF versus .RAW files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.57">Regardless of native file type, the use of a common API eliminates the need for storage and tracking of surrogate files; based on previous reports, this <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be particularly problematic for full profile data files, which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> grow significantly in size upon conversion to XML [9].</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="TableLegend"><Sentence id="S1.58">Access Efficiency for Open and Proprietary Mass Spectrometry Data Files.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.59">Given the multidimensional nature of mass-spectrometry data, extraction based on specific slices through the data space, rather than random file access, is a more relevant performance metric for mass spectrometry files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.60">Generation of RICs is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">perhaps</ccue> the best example of a data slice procedure supported by all manufacturer data systems.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.61">Consequently we next sought to <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">test</ccue> the performance of mzAPI for creation of RICs directly from a .RAW file.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.62">As a point of comparison we generated the corresponding mzXML file (using TPP version 4.0) [12] and extracted RICs using both a graphical user interface (GUI) based browser tool (InsilicosViewer version 1.5.1) [3] as well as the Perl-based InSilicoSpectro environment (version 1.3.19) [6] and the R-based XCMS (version 1.12.1), [13] scriptable interface platforms.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.63">Although the latter two are designed to access a number of third-party file formats, none of the GUI- or command-line based tools supports access to specified subsets (in chromatographic time) of the underlying data.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.64">As a result we generated RICs by extraction of a specific mass-to-charge range over the full data file, or in the case of InSilicoSpectro, which had no support for RIC generation, we simply timed the opening of mzXML files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.65">While the mzXML schema includes a scan index that provides for random access to scans at speeds competitive with, or exceeding, proprietary data system (in this case ThermoFisher Xcalibur) [9], Table 1 shows that generation of specific data slices, or in this case RICs, is 5- to 10-fold faster when leveraging the underlying manufacturer's API compared to GUI or command line based access to mzXML (scripts used for all timings included in Additional File 1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.66">This result supports the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">notion</ccue> that pragmatic data access patterns are well supported by existing, albeit proprietary, manufacturer libraries, and more importantly, that these libraries can be efficiently utilized through a common and redistributable API.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.67">multiplierz: An Open-Source and Interactive Environment for Proteomics Data Analysis</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.68">We extend the functionality of mzAPI by integration into multiplierz, an open-source Python-based environment that provides a flexible framework for comprehensive analysis of proteomics data.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.69">Figure 1 illustrates our proposed implementation; all associated code and scripts are available for download at: http://blais.dfci.harvard.edu/multiplierz.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.70">In the following sections, we provide a detailed description of core multiplierz capabilities.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.71">A Common API and Desktop Environment for Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.72">The multiplierz environment provides a central point for user interaction with proprietary data files (via mzAPI), protein/peptide identification algorithms, publicly available annotation databases, and commercial reporting and spreadsheet tools.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.73">Our proposal calls for manufacturers to provide a minimal set of libraries for access to their native data files.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.74">Ad hoc data analysis tasks are supported through multiplierz scripting capability, including programmatic access for integration into data analytic pipelines.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.75">Regardless of final experimental goals, peptide identification is often the first or default operation performed subsequent to LC-MS data acquisition.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.76">We designed multiplierz to serve as a user-friendly, desktop tool for interaction with proteomics database search engines; consistent with our zero-infrastructure philosophy, X!Tandem [14] is fully integrated into the multiplierz installation package.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.77">Similarly we include support for automated retrieval of Mascot search results.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.78">In this case, the URL for a particular search is easily and unambiguously accessed using the Mascot job ID (after completion of the search, the Mascot ID is both on the search submission page and in the Mascot Daemon).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.79">The multiplierz module for downloading Mascot search results also allows input for Mascot-specific export options such as "Require Bold Red" and "Maximum Number of Protein hits."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.80">Multiple search results are specified using either a comma- or dash-separated list of Mascot Job IDs (e.g., 6556, 5878, 5120-5125).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.81">Users can optionally include Mascot MS/MS fragment annotation images (that are displayed in multiple Mascot report web pages) and embed them within a singular multiplierz report; thus multiplierz provides users with comprehensive Mascot information, including images, in a convenient and portable report (described below).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.82">Importantly, none of the above tasks require server level administrative privileges.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.83">For example, query of MS/MS peak annotations typically requires logon credentials within the web browser.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.84">multiplierz interacts with the browser to "screen scrape" MS/MS images and store them within the default report format.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.85">Users with full access to the Mascot server <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> parse results directly from the .DAT file using .mz scripts (multiplierz reports and .mz scripts and described below).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.86">Similar support is also provided for Protein Pilot [15] and OMSSA [16].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.87">For maximum flexibility in conversion of parsed data from other search engines we include modules for generation of multiplierz-compatible spreadsheets.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.88">Calculation of a false discovery rate (FDR) for peptide sequence identifications is one mechanism to assess the overall quality of search results [17,18].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.89">multiplierz supports calculation of a FDR upon retrieval of peptide identification data from both forward and reverse database searches.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.90">The FDR for a given score threshold is calculated as the ratio of reverse database search identifications to that from the forward plus reverse searches, each with a score greater than or equal to the chosen threshold.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.91">The FDR thus represents the percentage of identified peptides in the forward search that would also be detected in the reverse database search.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.92">multiplierz identifies score thresholds for commonly used FDR (1%, 2%, and 5%) as well as calculates the FDR for each forward peptide score via an .mz Script (see below; scripts for generating a reverse database and calculating the FDR are included in Additional File 2).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.93">Correlation of identified peptide sequences with specific features in the source mass spectrometry data, such as chromatographic peak width or maximum precursor intensity, is often complicated by the requirement for users to move between disparate programs and interfaces.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.94">The multiplierz desktop environment provides users with a centralized point of interaction with both search results and the underlying mass spectrometry files.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.95">For example, high-confidence peptide identifications <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be used for direct generation of RICs across user-defined time and mass-to-charge ranges.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.96">Various metrics such as full peak width at half maximum (FWHM), peak area, and apex precursor intensity for peptide elution profiles are included in the output report.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.97">As described below these data are combined, annotated, and made available in portable, user-friendly reports.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.98">Consistent with our underlying motivation to combine open-source and commercial software where appropriate, we opted to export multiplierz results into Microsoft Excel.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.99">We take advantage of Excel's ability to store images in the worksheet (as comments), thereby creating an information-rich, yet portable, report that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be readily formatted to meet specific scientific journal data submission requirements [19].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.100">Moreover, we note that the tendency towards analysis of increasingly complex mixtures along with continued efforts in relative protein quantification have placed increased emphasis on data reproducibility in proteomics experiments.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.101">Hence it has become common practice to derive a "proteomics result" from comparison, or other manipulation, of multiple mass spectrometry acquisitions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.102">In support of this experimental paradigm, multiplierz includes "multi-detect" and "multi-filter" tools that provide users tremendous flexibility in filtering and collating (e.g., by common or unique proteins, peptides, post-translational modifications, charge state, etc.) each data file obtained from a multiple acquisition study.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.103">This feature provides database-like functionality without the need to install and maintain dedicated database servers.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.104">Importantly, all multiplierz functions provide spreadsheet-based output with optional embedded images (see Figure 2 and discussion below).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart

type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.113">The highly embedded, spreadsheet-based multiplierz reports provide a very flexible and user-friendly mechanism to query various metrics of the underlying native mass spectrometry data and quickly collate search results based on user-defined filter criteria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.114">However, it is often the case that researchers must go beyond these general characterizations and focus on a small subset of their proteomics data in support of targeted biological questions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.115">To enable this mode of data analysis, multiplierz includes a Peak Viewer tool (Figure 3) that provides dynamic and interactive plots for precursor RICs, and corresponding MS and MS/MS scans.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.116">Additionally, users can edit and export publication quality images through a built-in Scrapbook tool (Figure 4).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.117">Features of the Peak Viewer include (i) visualization of theoretical fragments superimposed on MS/MS spectra, (ii) automatic zoom-in display for iTRAQ and theoretical ions for rapid manual validation, and (iii) comparison of scans and RICs via mirror and overlay functions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.118">For added convenience the Peak Viewer opens multiplierz spreadsheets and users can generate plots by a simple double-click on specific rows or peptide

Scrapbook plots.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.129">Researchers are increasingly focused on integration of disparate data types in order to better understand biological phenomena at the so-called network or systems level.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.130">As a first step in support of these and similar activities, multiplierz automatically downloads GenBank data over the internet based on an identified protein list, parses information such as gene ontology and domain classification, along with the corresponding Entrez Gene, HPRD, HGNC, and OMIM entries, and then creates hyperlinks directly in the spreadsheet reports.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.131">This and other tools including an in silico protein digestion tool and a peptide fragment calculator are described in Additional File 3.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.132">While multiplierz includes many built-in features and tools, we also recognize the difficulty of building a "one size fits all" application given the diversity of ideas and efforts pursued within individual research laboratories.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.133">Hence multiplierz includes a command line console as well as scripting capability (through ".mz" scripts) which together support ad hoc data analysis tasks.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.134">The scripting capability is particularly useful for niche experiments or proteomics workflows not otherwise supported by other open-source or proprietary data systems.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.135">All multiplierz tools are available through both the desktop GUI as well as scriptable procedures.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.136">In addition, a pre-launch initialization ("rc.mz") script enables full customization of the application and its interfaces without recompiling the underlying code.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.137">Finally, we note that programmatic access to mzAPI allows incorporation of multiplierz into automated data-analytic pipelines.</Sentence><Sentence

type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.21">Background</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.22">In recent years it has become clear that proteins with highly modular architectures possess numerous short peptide motifs that are essential to their function [1-5].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Such peptides are termed Linear Motifs (LM) as, in contrast to the globular domains, their function is independent of tertiary structure and encoded solely by the amino acid sequence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">They are found in a diverse range of proteins, such as membrane receptors, adaptors, scaffolds and transcription factors, and mediate numerous tasks, which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be as disparate as directing subcellular localization or acting as sites of cleavage.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">Well-known LMs include peptides binding SH3, Cyclin, PDZ and WW domains [6-10] and phosphorylated peptides interacting with SH2, PTB, BRCT and FHA phosphopeptide-binding domains [11-17].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">The biological properties and range of functions mediated by LMs are reviewed in detail elsewhere [4,18-20].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">In order to deconvolute the functional components of modular protein architectures, it is necessary to identify the set of LMs as well as the folded components.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">However, this is not straightforward because simple searches with short sequence patterns, known to act as functional modules, are uninformative - returning a flood of false positive matches.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Several tools have been developed to rank motifs based on confidence of functionality by classifying putative motifs based on the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesis</ccue> that functional motifs will have attributes similar to experimentally discovered motifs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Although classification tools <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">cannot definitely confirm</ccue> a motif as functional (only experimental analysis <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> achieve this) they can be used to attach a level of confidence to a motif.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">For example motifs which occur in an incorrect cellular compartment, or outside the known taxonomic range, are <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">unlikely</ccue> to be functional as are those which are not conserved in closely related proteins or buried in a globular domain inaccessible for interaction.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Available motif discovery tools vary in their implementation of confidence-related metrics.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">ScanProsite [21], the web-based tool for detecting PROSITE [22] signature matches in protein sequences, recently integrated ProRules [23], a database containing additional information about PROSITE profiles, with the aim of increasing the discriminatory power of PROSITE profiles to facilitate function determination and provide biologically relevant information for the annotation of proteins.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">MnM [24,25], a motif database and a web-based tool for identifying candidate motif occurrences in proteins, addresses the issue of non-functional false positives by implementing evolutionary conservation, surface prediction and frequency scores to rank motif occurrences in a protein query.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">The Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) resource filters implausible motif occurrences according to cell compartment and taxonomic range [2].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.36">It also indicates less likely matches that lie within globular domains annotated in the SMART [26] and Pfam [27] resources and contrasts these with intrinsically unstructured polypeptide (IUP) regions predicted by GlobPlot [28] that are more <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">likely</ccue> to be motif-rich [5].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">DILIMOT and SLiMFinder - tools designed for discovery of candidate novel peptide patterns significantly enriched in protein interaction datasets - also use some of these techniques to improve confidence in returned motifs [29,30].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">Sequence conservation has also been shown to be effective in up-weighting true motifs relative to false positive matches [31-33].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">In the intracellular milieu, LMs are found to be particularly abundant in segments of IUP where they are readily accessible [34].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">Accessibility is a basic requirement of LM function which is almost always mediated by direct interaction with globular domain ligands.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">Extracellular proteins tend to have much less natively disordered polypeptide and therefore the extracellular linear motifs such as N-glycosylation sites [35] and the integrin-binding RGD motif [36] usually occur within globular domains, most often residing in exposed loop regions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">LMs are also regularly found in globular regions of intracellular proteins - for example phosphorylation sites are common in flexible loops [37].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">However, close inspection of the literature also reveals many instances of candidate motifs falsely reported as functional on the basis of loss of function mutagenesis and out-of-context peptide-binding experiments, despite the motif being well structured and sometimes deeply buried in a globular domain [38-41].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">This observation <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggests</ccue> that stringent examination of motif structural context <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">should</ccue> be an essential processing step for experimental analysis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">It also <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">advocates</ccue> the importance of high quality tools to identify such cases, as the cost associated with failure is detrimental both in terms of effort and quality of the literature.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">Despite this, neither the ELM globular domain classification nor the MnM surface prediction score take advantage of all the information available to them in the form of the plethora of experimentally solved protein structures.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">ELM globular domain classification is overly strict, classifying motifs occurring in these regions as low confidence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">The MnM surface prediction score uses primary sequence based prediction both in those cases where a structure is available and in regions where a disorder predictor will render secondary structure prediction unnecessary.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">In the present manuscript, we address the issue of LM accessibility when the matches occur within globular domains for which a reference three-dimensional (3D) structure is available.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">Development and calibration of a structure filter is currently not straightforward as there are relatively few available structures for most motif classes (an obvious exception being N-glycosylation sites), placing limitations on the training and benchmarking possibilities.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">Nevertheless, we have been able to develop a protocol in which reference domain structures are selected and then the matched motifs evaluated

of a motif match is calculated on the non-wildcard positions of the regular expression pattern for the motif as: where N is the number of non-wildcard positions of a match, i.e. the number of

transcription factors in groups of co-regulated genes is a well-studied problem with a great deal of practical relevance to the biologist, since such binding sites provide targets for mutational analyses (for reviews see 123).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">The position-specific variability of transcription factor binding sites makes their de novo identification challenging.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">Many computational motif finding methods are based on the observation that transcription factor binding sites occur more often than expected by chance in the upstream regions of the set of genes regulated by the same transcription factor 1.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">The problem thus simplifies to the identification of overrepresented motifs in a given set of upstream sequences.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">Motif finding programs rely on a search algorithm to optimize a motif model (an abstract representation of a set of transcription factor binding sites).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">Most recent programs represent motifs as position weight matrices (PWMs), which record the frequency of each base at every position in the motif.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">Other motif finding programs have relied on the use of consensus motif models (in which every base is represented by a letter of the 15-letter IUPAC code, which accounts for degeneracies as well as single bases) or k-mismatch motif models (in which a non-degenerate word with at most k allowed mismatches is used to represent the word).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Regardless of the motif model used, a search for all overrepresented motifs of any length and degree of degeneracy leads to a dauntingly large search space.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Thus, motif finding algorithms restrict their search space by using simplified motif representations, employing heuristic search strategies that are prone to local optima, or invoking additional parameters to limit the search space and thereby pass some of the optimization process off to the user 3.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">Program parameters (such as motif length, number of occurrences and orientation) that cannot be reasonably specified by the user without prior knowledge about the true binding sites are referred to as nuisance parameters 4.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">Selection of the correct settings for these parameters is a crucial step in motif finding, and is often <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">assumed</ccue> to be the domain of experts.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">In a recent evaluation, Hu and colleagues 4 compared the performance of five motif finders on a single prokaryotic genome, systematically exploring the effects of nuisance parameters, including expected motif length and number of occurrences.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">Every motif finder they tested was found to be sensitive to values used for these parameters.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">Guidance on the specific parameter settings to use for given motif finding situations is not provided in most publications presenting motif finders.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Even <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">assuming</ccue> that optimal parameter settings exist for a motif finding program for each specific situation, for the typical biologist looking to identify motifs in a set of uncharacterized sequences, acquiring such expertise is an onerous task.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Nuisance parameters complicate the interpretation of performance comparisons as well.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">A recent large-scale performance comparison between thirteen different motif finding tools used expert knowledge in setting the parameters for every program 5.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Several of the programs contributing to the performance comparison were run with different parameter settings for each regulon, and in some cases, motifs were hand filtered as a post-processing step.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">Such performance comparisons evaluate not just algorithms but also the expertise of the users, making it difficult for a first-time user to select a motif finder on a principled basis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">A key result of the Tompa, et al. study was the finding that all of the motif finders had roughly the same average performance under a wide range of conditions and test statistics 5.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">This finding was particularly notable because the motif finders studied employed a wide range of motif representations, scoring functions and search strategies and all were operated under the most favorable conditions possible.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.36">Although the average performance of the programs did not differ significantly, the authors found that, for each pair of programs, each program performed better than the other on some subset of the data 5.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">Previous studies over smaller numbers of motif finders have found that no program clearly stands out as superior to the others and each program outperforms all others on some subset of the regulons 678.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">This diversity of performance has led a number of authors to <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">speculate</ccue> that ensemble methods, comprising multiple motif finders, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> lead to improvements in accuracy 158.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">Ensemble methods, well known in the machine learning community 9, are typically composed of multiple methods comprising different search strategies (or the same search strategies with different initiation settings or random restarts) with a unified objective function.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">The final predictions are chosen from the ensemble of methods by a learning rule, which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be as simple as finding the maximum score from all the methods, or as complex as optimizing a weighted scoring scheme from among the methods.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">The construction of this learning rule is key to the performance of an ensemble learning method, as the performance of an ensemble method with an ineffective learning rule will be the average of the performance of its component algorithms.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">In this context, we note that Tompa et al. 5 found that, although every motif finding program tested had some regulons on which its performance was clearly superior, it was not <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue> a priori to predict which motif finder represented the best choice under any given set of conditions 5.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">This observation serves to illustrate the challenges to the construction of an effective learning rule.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">To the best of our knowledge, only one study to date has explored ensemble learning in motif finding.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">Hu, Li and Kihara 4 described a simple ensemble method wherein the component programs were random restarts of the same stochastic algorithm (such as Gibbs sampling or Expectation Maximization) and the learning rule was a voting scheme in which the results of each random restart cast a "vote" for which positions in the DNA sequence should be part of the final reported motif (hereafter, we refer to this as the HLK method).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">Under this scheme, the authors found that ensemble learning resulted in an increase in performance ranging from 6 to 45%.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">The HLK voting method provides a framework wherein a number of different motifs finders <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be combined under the heuristic that <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">if</ccue> several motif finders make the same (or overlapping) prediction, then that prediction is accurate.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">Here we present a novel ensemble motif finder based on a different conceptual approach.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">Rather than randomly restarting the same search algorithm <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> comparing multiple search strategies that all search for the same global optimum (and are <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">potentially</ccue> vulnerable to the same local optima), our algorithm <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">assumes</ccue> that the ""biological significance surface"" primarily consists of three local optima, and that one of these peaks represents the global optimum.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">Thus, our ensemble uses three specialized algorithms whose search spaces restrict them to each of these three local optima (BEAM for non-degenerate motifs, PRISM for degenerate motifs and SPACER for bipartite motifs).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">We have previously demonstrated that the greedy search strategies employed by each of these methods allow them to reliably search their respective motif domains without the use of nuisance parameters, as the algorithms themselves efficiently optimize the parameters that are typically forced on the users 101112.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.52">The results of these component algorithms are then combined using a learning rule that is simply the maximum score returned by each component algorithm.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.53">To make comparisons possible, the motif scores returned by each algorithm are penalized according to the complexity of the motif.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.54">The resulting ensemble algorithm, SCOPE, has no nuisance parameters and performs significantly better than its component algorithms.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.55">In addition, we find that SCOPE performs favorably compared to a diverse range of existing methods and is robust to the presence of extraneous sequences in its

id="S1.99">These objective functions were as follows: position bias (based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, or KS, statistic), overrepresentation (a Poisson-based measure based on how often a motif occurs

representing myriad search strategies, objective functions and motif models.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.215">Yet remarkably, performance comparisons consistently reveal disappointing performance for motif finders and fail to find any statistical significance between them.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.216">A brief survey of the per-regulon results of these performance comparisons yields two key observations: (1) there are many regulons for which a large number of programs find a small portion of the binding sites (though not necessarily the same portion); and (2) every program has a respectable number of "wins" (i.e. every program is the best existing program on some handful of regulons 145678.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.217">Such observations are common in many machine learning applications, and are the direct result of complex search spaces that force restrictions on either the search strategy or the representation of the solution space (in this case, the motif model used to represent the motifs).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.218">For example, YMF and RSAT are guaranteed to find the optimal solutions in their motif space (fixed-length motifs with limited degeneracies), but that space is limited to the point that optimality provides no clear advantage over the other methods.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.219">Conversely, the PWM-based methods have an apparently more powerful motif model 17, but their search strategies cannot guarantee optimality and often terminate at local optima.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.220">The HLK ensemble method 4 successfully exploits the first key observation above.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.221">By running the same (stochastic) algorithm multiple times and using a voting method, those subsequences of the binding sites that are repeatedly reported become clear while the spurious bases are eliminated.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.222">Hu and colleagues report that this method increased accuracy and <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">proposed</ccue> that their approach <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> prove effective when running different algorithms as well 4.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.223">The limitation arises, however, in regulons where only one program has a high accuracy and the others fail to find any portion of the binding sites.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.224">In such cases, it is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">likely</ccue> that a voting-based ensemble will follow the crowd and fail to find the true binding site.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.225">The second observation, that all motif finders win some number of regulons and often perform roughly the same on average, is broadly consistent with a theorem in the Machine Learning field referred to as the No Free Lunch Theorem 1819.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.226">Briefly, this theorem states that, averaged over all datasets, the performance of all search algorithms are exactly the same, with the corollary that two algorithms will have the exact same number of wins in relation to each other.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.227">In practice, this theorem argues for the use of specialized domain knowledge 20, where available, and <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that similar average performance across a diversity of approaches is an <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indication</ccue> of the diversity of the datasets themselves.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.228">Thus, motif finders designed for one class of motifs will win on regulons containing those motifs, but will perform poorly on other regulons, while more general motif finders will <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">tend</ccue> to have more consistently mediocre performance.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.229">In this light, SCOPE <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> be <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">seen</ccue> as leveraging the second key observation by embracing the No Free Lunch Theorem:: rather than boost average performance by taking the average results of three general purpose algorithms, SCOPE uses highly specialized algorithms and <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">assumes</ccue> each will perform strongly on some regulons and weakly on others (and that the unified scoring metric can tell the difference).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.230">The working <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesis</ccue> is, in effect, that the local maxima are predictable (corresponding to one of three motif classes) and exploitable (we can find the local maxima in each class and choose whichever is higher).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.231">Consistent with this hypothesis, there was very little overlap among the component algorithms of SCOPE (each wins about 20 of the 78 regulons, with very few ties) and, by taking the maximum score from those three local maxima, SCOPE tended to choose the motif with the highest accuracy in a clear majority of the cases (66%, compared to 33% for a random learning rule).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.232">Furthermore, SCOPE not only significantly outperformed its components on this dataset, it also outperformed a number of general purpose algorithms that seek to find the global maximum in a single pass.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.233">Of course, based on the No Free Lunch Theorem, SCOPE's performance averaged over all theoretically possible datasets will still converge to that of the other motif finding approaches (including random guessing).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.234">As the physical properties of transcription factors will inevitably constrain the structure of their binding sites, biologically relevant datasets comprise a subset of the space of all theoretically possible sequences.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.235">Our test set of 78 regulons was selected in a blinded manner (for details, see Additional file 1, section S3), thus these results <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> the generalizability of SCOPE's use of domain knowledge on biologically relevant datasets from these species.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.236">These observations are not offered as definitive proof that there are only three classes of motifs; rather, they show that power can be gained by identifying distinct motif classes and combining specialized algorithms with a unified scoring rule.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.237">It is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue> that more power <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> be gained by identifying other distinct motif classes and adding algorithms that explicitly search for those classes.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.238">For example, Zinc finger transcription factors have been demonstrated to bind three triplets of nucleotides which overlap at their third base positions 21.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.239">This observation <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> be leveraged by a search algorithm that explicitly searches for motifs matching this unique structure.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.240">Thus, all nondegenerate triplets in a set of upstream regions <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> be scored and the highest-scoring triplets combined into a single five-mer with a two-base degeneracy (corresponding to the IUPAC characters R,Y, W, S, K or M) at the middle position.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.241">The highest-scoring five-mers <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> then be combined with the highest scoring triplets to generate a seven-mer with two-base degeneracies at positions three and five.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.242">Provided the appropriate Bonferroni correction is applied for this new class of motifs, these motifs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be easily compared with the results from BEAM, PRISM and SPACER, thereby extending the SCOPE ensemble to include a fourth class of motifs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.243">We note, however, that as more methods are added to SCOPE, it will be increasingly difficult to devise a scoring metric that can accurately choose the best result from among the components.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.244">SCOPE <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> also serve as a complementary approach to the HLK method.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.245">For example, the parameters of many methods can be set to search for specific classes of motifs (such as bipartite versus non-bipartite motifs).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.246">Thus, analogous to the ensemble method described in this paper, one <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> build a hierarchical ensemble that first searches each motif class by the HLK method using a number of algorithms or random restarts, and then uses the SCOPE method to choose the best result from among the motif classes.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.247">One constraint associated with such an approach is the run-time.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.248">A second constraint associated with a hierarchical ensemble learning method is the multiplicative increase in the number of parameters associated with it, though this problem <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be ameliorated by the use of parameter-free algorithms that employ restricted search spaces.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.249">An important factor to consider when taking the best of multiple runs is the relative size of the search space.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.250">Certainly to maintain statistical validity, some correction must be made for multiple hypothesis testing.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.251">Furthermore, the effects of multiple testing <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> bias the results in favor of one of the component algorithms.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.252">To ensure statistical validity and avoid such a bias, we developed a simple Bonferroni-like correction, which penalized every proposed motif proportional to its length and degree of degeneracy, resulting in a modest improvement of 8% in SCOPE's accuracy.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.253">Although our test set of 78 regulons gave us enough power to find significance between SCOPE and its components or other algorithms, it did not provide enough power to disentangle the effects of small improvements (such as the Bonferroni correction, the objective function that takes position bias into account, or scoring motifs based off one or both strands), especially in the rigorous cross-validation framework necessary to decipher precisely which aspects contribute significantly to the performance.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.254">Nevertheless, as larger datasets become available, SCOPE's efficient search strategy makes it an ideal platform for exploring the effect of focused improvements to the motif finding approach described, such as the use of complex objective functions that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> better approximate biological significance.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.255">The comparisons to other motif finding programs in this study are provided to place SCOPE's performance in the broader context of the motif finding field, particularly when viewed from the standpoint of the practicing "bench" biologist.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.256">Any performance comparison must be interpreted with caution, since the results are highly dependent on the dataset used, the conditions of the testing and the metrics used for evaluation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.257">With this in mind, we sought to evaluate a wide representation of motif finders on a large number of regulons using performance metrics consistent with previous studies 67.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.258">To the best of our knowledge, this dataset represents the largest set of biologically relevant regulons used for performance comparisons to date.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.259">Whereas previous performance comparisons attempt to optimize the parameters of the programs in question 467 or allow expert users to tune their own programs and manually filter both the input and output 5 we intentionally made our comparisons between programs without manually optimizing any parameters for any species so as to emulate typical use conditions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.260">Our comparison thus complements the recent large scale study of Tompa et al., who gauge performance under optimal conditions on semi-synthetic data sets 5, as well as the study of Hu et al., who explore the effect of parameter optimization on a handful of popular motif finders 4.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.261">Although the present philosophy of performance comparison implicitly benefits SCOPE, which has no parameters to optimize, it is arguably the most relevant comparison possible for the typical biologist.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.262">Although previous studies have shown the <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">potential</ccue> importance of choosing parameters carefully 46, we note that the results we obtained under default settings were quite similar to those reported in previous studies (for details, see Additional file 1, section S3).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.263">Arguably, systematic parameter optimization for each of these programs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> well yield higher accuracy scores than those reported here.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.264">However, in order to avoid the pitfall of overfitting to the dataset, such parameter optimization must be performed using cross-validation or some other resampling technique 92223.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.265">We note that all the motif finders tested, including SCOPE, performed poorly on the Drosophila dataset.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.266">Although SCOPE had the highest accuracy on this dataset, that accuracy was significantly less than on the bacterial and yeast data.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.267">Especially poor performance on Drosophila was also reported in the Tompa et al. performance comparison, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicating</ccue> that this difficulty is not limited to the current dataset 5.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.268">One <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue> cause of poor performance in this study is that the ""regulons"" are derived from enhancer regions defined in an earlier computational paper 24.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.269">Whereas a background set of promoter regions is easy to identify, it is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">not clear</ccue> how to define a reasonable genomic sample of enhancers.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.270">Thus, the background sequences used by SCOPE and the other programs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> not be representative of the ""true"" background model of enhancers, leading to inaccurate statistics.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.271">The

type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.283">Each algorithm's accuracy for each regulon was measured via the Phi score (also referred to as nucleotide level performance coefficient, or nPC, in previous performance comparisons 45611.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.284">This metric, first proposed by Pevzner and Sze 29, measures the degree of overlap between the actual instances of two motifs (or sets of motifs) m1 and m2 in the set of co-regulated upstream sequences.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.285">The Phi score can be defined as follows: let U be a unique numbering of all the bases in the upstream sequences of a given gene set, and IU(m) ⊆ U be the set of bases that are covered by actual instances of m in U.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.286">Phi is then defined as the ratio of the number of bases occupied by the actual instances of both the motifs, to the total number of bases occupied by the actual instances of either of the two motifs:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.287">ΦU(m1, m2) = [IU(m1) ∩ IU(m2)]/[IU(m1) ∪ IU(m2)].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.288">This metric therefore takes both false positives and false negatives into account at the level of the individual bases that are actually covered by the motif.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.289">As in Hu et al. 4, we define accuracy to be the Phi score between the known and predicted binding sites.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.290">Changing

Significance</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.293">In line with other motif finders, we have used statistical significance as a surrogate for biological significance.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.294">Since the latter cannot be defined without data that obviates the need for computational motif finding, objective functions that approximate biological significance are critical.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.295">In this section, we detail the objective functions we used and their effect on SCOPE's performance.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.296">For any motif m, each objective function provides a definition for p(m), the probability of observing a motif with the same sufficient statistics as m assuming a particular null model.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.297">This p-value is used in the computation of the Sig score (see Results).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.298">Overrepresentation</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.299">The most common statistical test in motif finding is based on overrepresentation, which can be roughly defined as the probability that a motif m that is observed C(m) times in the regulon would occur at least C(m) times in a random collection of the same number of genes.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.300">In the context of consensus motifs, overrepresentation is expressed in terms of a multinomial model, in which each position i in each gene j is a random variable Xij that can take on any motif allowed by the particular motif model.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.301">The probability of seeing m at least C(m) times in the regulon can be approximated by the Poisson distribution: p(m) = ∑k≥C(m) [(λke-λ)/k! ] where λ is the expectation of C(m) with respect to the null motif distribution and the number of positions in the regulon.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.302">A detailed justification of this approach was given by Carlson et al. 11.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.303">The expectation λ is most accurately modeled using Maximum Likelihood Estimators (MLEs) computed as the actual proportion of any given motif in the complete set of all upstream sequences in the genome 10.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.304">These MLEs are implemented as lookups of exact substrings, which

overrepresentation with the modification that C(m) is the number of upstream regions in the regulon that have one or more instances of m and λ, the expectation of C(m), is determined from the proportion of upstream regions in the genome that contain the motif.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.307">While this objective function prevents a single upstream region from dominating a motif's score, it fails to account for multiple instances of a binding site in a single gene that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> arise due to cooperative binding.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.308">Positional bias</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.309">Transcription factors often require their binding sites to be located in a restricted range relative to the start of transcription.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.310">One well known example is TBP (TATA-binding protein), which localizes the RNA polymerase complex by binding the TATA-box motif roughly 25 bases upstream of the transcription start site 30.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.311">While other examples of binding sites with positional restrictions are well known, few motif finders incorporate position in their scoring function.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.312">In the case where all upstream regions are the same length, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic provides a natural test for positional bias.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.313">The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic is a non-parametric statistic that measures the probability that two samples are drawn from the same distribution.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.314">Let X be the sample that we wish to compare to some reference sample Y.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.315">The KS statistic is defined to be the maximum absolute difference between the unbiased cumulative distribution functions of X and Y.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.316">The KS statistic has a well-defined distribution from which a p-value can be easily computed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.317">Kuiper's variation was used to increase sensitivity in the tails of the distribution 31.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.318">In the context of motifs, we defined the test sample X for a motif m to be the set of starting positions (with respect to transcription start sites) of m in the regulon.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.319">The reference sample Y is defined as the set of starting positions of m in all upstream regions in the genome.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.320">Thus, pKS(m) is a measure of how m is localized differently in the regulon than in the genome as a whole.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.321">It is also <ccue
