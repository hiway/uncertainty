id="S1.16">Background</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.17">The understanding of gene function in a poorly studied Arthropod such as the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (subphylum Chelicerata: order Acari: suborder Ixodida) <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> benefit from the knowledge generated by genome-wide resources of the model insect Drosophila melanogaster (subphylum Mandibulata: order Hexapoda: suborder Insecta).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">The genome of the fruit fly D. melanogaster was among the first eukaryotic genomes to be sequenced and assembled [1].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">D. melanogaster and R. microplus evolved from a common ancestor ca. 500 million years ago [2].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">In comparison to the existing comprehensive genome resources for the fruit fly D. melanogaster, the cattle tick genome resources are limited to approximately 45,000 EST sequences [3].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">In addition, the tick genome size of 7.1 Gbp [2] compared to the D. melanogaster of 139 Mbp [4] will <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">likely</ccue> delay the generation of a complete R. microplus genome sequence [5].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">A genome project for the related tick species, Ixodes scapularis, with an estimated genome size of 2.1 Gbp, is currently underway [6].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Although there are many invertebrate genomes completed including worms, nematodes, beetle, wasp, honey bee, flies, and mosquitoes http://www.genome.gov/, I. scapularis will be the first Chelicerate:Arachnida genome sequence available representing mites, ticks, scorpions and spiders.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">Among the many methods available for reverse genetic studies, RNA interference (RNAi) has gained popularity because of its demonstrated efficient post transcriptional gene-silencing effects in plants, fungi, nematodes, flies and cultured mammalians cells (reviewed by [7-11]).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">RNA mediated gene silencing is a widely conserved mechanism in eukaryotes and can be categorized into two partially overlapping pathways, the RNAi pathway and the microRNA (miRNA) pathway.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">The RNAi pathway is triggered by exogenous or endogenous dsRNAs that are recognized by Dicer RNase III proteins which 'dice' these molecules into double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21–23 nt in length [12].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">A typical eukaryotic Dicer consists of 2 helicase domains, a PAZ domain, 2 RNAse domains and a dsRNA-binding domain (dsRBD) [12,13], however some variations in this domain structure have been noted for insect Dicers [14].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">D. melanogaster has 2 Dicer enzymes, Dcr-1 and Dcr-2 which are responsible for miRNA and siRNA production respectively [15].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">By contrast most other animals contain a single Dicer that generates both siRNAs and miRNAs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">The next phase in the RNAi pathway involves the loading of siRNAs into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">dsRNA binding motif proteins (dsRBM), such as D. melanogaster R2D2 and Caenorhabditiselegans Rde-4 help siRNAs to be loaded properly into silencing complexes [16,17].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Using the siRNAs as a guide, RISCs find target mRNAs and cleave them.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">Argonaute (Ago) family proteins are the main components of silencing complexes, mediating target recognition and silencing [18-20].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">Most organisms have multiple members of the Ago proteins, for example both insect species D. melanogaster and Tribolium castaneum (beetle) have 5, whereas C. elegans (nematode) has 27 [14,21-25].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">In Drosophila Ago-1 and Ago-2 are known to be associated with RISC [21].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.36">In C. elegans, the primary siRNAs processed by Dicer can also trigger the amplification of siRNAs through a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) to produce secondary dsRNAs in a two-step mechanism involving secondary Argonaute proteins [26-28].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">This mechanism has not been demonstrated in other animals to date and is commonly found in plants rather than animals.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">An additional phenomenon identified in plants and C. elegans is the systemic spread of RNAi from cell to cell throughout the organism and its <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">potential</ccue> systemic transfer to subsequent generations through the germ-line [29-31].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">Proteins related to this phenomenon in C. elegans include Sid-1, which encodes a multi-transmembrane domain protein <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">thought</ccue> to act as a channel for dsRNA uptake, and RNAi spreading defective proteins (Rsd-2, Rsd-3 and Rsd-6) shown to be required for the systemic RNAi response [32,33].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">Originally, systemic RNAi was <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">thought</ccue> to be unique to C. elegans in animals, however preliminary evidence <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggests</ccue> that silkworm, honeybee, wasp and beetle utilize a Sid-1-like (sil) protein not found in mosquitoes or flies (reviewed by Tomoyasu et al [14]).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">Furthermore, over 20 genes identified as necessary for dsRNA uptake in Drosophila cultured cells have also been identified in other insect species [14,34-36].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">The specific mechanisms associated with dsRNA uptake and systemic RNAi in Arthropods including some insect species are thus currently undefined.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">Of the above described proteins associated with RNAi pathways, only one RNAi tick protein has been identified to date, a putative R. microplus Ago-2 [37].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">RNAi pathways in Arthropods other than fruit flies and mosquitoes are beginning to <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">demonstrate</ccue> that there are evolutionary variations in these pathways with a higher level of divergence within the Arthropoda than previously thought [14,38-41].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">Similarly, long dsRNAs have been successfully applied in R. microplus [42] and other tick species (e.g. Amblyomma, Ixodes, Haemaphysalis, and Dermacentor spp.) for targeted gene knockdown to demonstrate the function of tick-specific genes in various tick life stages, with some studies producing evidence of systemic RNAi spread into subsequent stages (reviewed by de la Fuente et al [37]).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">With the advent of increasing Arthropod genome resources, it <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">feasible</ccue> to identify more putative tick homologues of essential RNAi pathway-associated proteins to better elucidate the tick RNAi mechanism.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">Improving the understanding of the mechanisms used by ticks for gene knockdown will assist to develop specific tick RNA interference reagents and improved techniques for gene functional studies.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">In this study we provide evidence for the presence of RNAi pathway associated proteins in R. microplus ESTs and I. scapularis genome reads, including a tick homologue for Dicer, Argonaute proteins, RdRP and proteins associated with dsRNA uptake and processing, and thus <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">propose</ccue> a <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">putative</ccue> tick RNAi pathway.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">We then determined <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> targeting genes in the cattle tick which are homologous to D. melanogaster genes with known RNAi in vitro phenotypes [43] would similarly result in abnormal phenotypes.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">We identified 10 candidate genes and conducted in vitro and in vivo (female tick injections) RNAi loss-of-function assays.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">Interestingly, only proteasomal genes impaired tick cell viability in vitro, whilst 9 candidates impaired tick egg and larval development in vivo.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart

central nervous system (CNS).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">These tumors typically proliferate rapidly, diffusely infiltrate the brain, and resist standard chemotherapies, properties that render them largely incurable.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">One key to developing more effective therapies against these tumors is to understand the genetic and molecular logic underlying gliomagenesis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">The most frequent genetic lesions in gliomas include mutation or amplification of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">Glioma-associated EGFR mutant forms show constitutive kinase activity that chronically stimulates Ras signaling to drive cellular proliferation and migration [1],[2].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">Other common genetic lesions include loss of the lipid phosphatase PTEN, which antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, and activating mutations in PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K [1],[2].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Gliomas often show constitutively active Akt, a major PI3K effector [1],[2].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">However, EGFR-Ras or PI3K mutations alone are not sufficient to transform glial cells, rather multiple mutations that coactivate EGFR-Ras and PI3K-Akt pathways are sufficient to induce glioma [2]–[4].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Understanding the interplay of these mutations and the neurodevelopmental origins of these tumors <ccue

maintain proliferative capacities, including differentiated astrocytes, glial progenitors, and multipotent neural stem cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">EGFR-Ras and PTEN-PI3K signaling regulates many developmental processes in these cell types, particularly proliferation and self-renewal, which are also properties of glioma cells [1].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">Although recent hypotheses <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">favor</ccue> that gliomas arise from multipotent stem cells, data from mouse models demonstrate that differentiated glia, glial progenitors, and stem cells can all produce gliomas in response to genetic lesions found in human gliomas [5],[6].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">Thus, misregulation of these genetic pathways <ccue

id="S1.24">The mechanisms that control the coordinate projection of pre- and postsynaptic neurites to a common region are incompletely understood.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">Although there has been substantial progress in identifying molecular mechanisms of axon growth and guidance, far less is known about the way in which appropriate target areas are identified, leading to termination and branching [1]–[4].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">The extent to which these processes depend on target specific signals as opposed to pervasive guidance cues, to which many different neurons can respond, is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">far from clear</ccue>.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">We have used the axons of embryonic Drosophila sensory neurons as a model system in which to study the way in which growing neurons are guided to terminate in a specific region of the developing nervous system.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">These neurons have their cell bodies in the periphery of the embryo, either close to or embedded in the body wall.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Their axons grow into a central ganglion where they terminate in a neuropile that consists of a dense meshwork of interweaving axons and dendrites.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Anatomically the neuropile shows few overt signs of organisation apart from clear regularities such as the commissures that cross the midline and a set of longitudinal axon bundles at stereotyped positions that provide a series of landmarks with respect to which other structures can be mapped [5].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Functionally however the neuropile is an obviously well-organised structure, with, for example, motor neuron dendrites and the endings of sensory neurons terminating and branching in distinct and characteristic domains.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Thus it is clear that there <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">must</ccue> be cues operating in the neuropile that deliver terminals to these specific destinations within the forming network.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">In the case of the sensory neurons, it is clear that specific types of neurons serving particular modalities terminate in well ordered and characteristically different parts of the neuropile.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">These termination zones together with the overall structure of the neuropile are shown in diagrammatic form in Figure 1.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">Because the sensory neurons provide us with an accessible set of cells whose terminals grow to different parts of the forming neuropile, we can readily use these neurons to <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">investigate</ccue> the guidance mechanisms that operate to <ccue

neuron classes project to different medio-lateral domains and to different dorso-ventral layers of neuropile.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.37">We previously showed that Slit secreted at the midline and acting through its Robo receptors constitutes a repellent gradient to which sensory neurons respond by terminating and branching at specific positions in the medio-lateral axis of the neuropile [6].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">Expression of a particular Robo receptor by a sensory axon is necessary and sufficient to determine the distance from the midline at which that axon will terminate.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">Thus, in the medio-lateral axis at least, the position at which an axon terminates within the forming neuropile is determined not by some putative signals from its postsynaptic target, but by the presynaptic neuron's response to a pervasive cue secreted from the midline.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">However, the neuropile is a 3-D structure and there <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">must</ccue> therefore be additional cues that determine the dorso-ventral and antero-posterior termination domains for each axonal and dendritic arbor.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">Our previous study provided evidence for at least one further signal that operates to determine positions in the dorso-ventral axis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">Sensory terminals that are shifted experimentally along the medio-lateral axis of the neuropile maintain their characteristic dorso-ventral location in their new position, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that the factor that determines this position <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be a “dorso-ventral” patterning cue that is present at different positions in the medio-lateral axis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">This additional finding led us to propose a general model for the cues that delineate domains within a neuropile in which presynaptic axons and their postsynaptic partners terminate and form connections [6].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">In this model, termination sites depend on the response of axons to a system of positional cues that dictate the behaviour and final location of many, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">perhaps</ccue> all terminals within a developing network of pre- and postsynaptic neurons.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">Specific locations are given not by the target, but by the set of receptors for these positional cues that each neuron expresses.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">Here, we test and augment this model by using a genetic screen to identify cues and their receptors that guide terminating axons in the dorso-ventral axis of the neuropile.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">We find that dorso-ventral layers of neuropile contain different levels and combinations of semaphorins.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">We demonstrate the

id="S1.50">These signals together with the Slit/Robo system acting in the medio-lateral axis limit the arborisations of sensory axons to specific termination domains within the neuropile.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">Since these are the domains within which specific functional sets of connections will be formed, the terminating sensory axons, by responding to pervasive

neurons terminate in the upper central layer (layer 2) [6],[9],[11].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.61">The ch neurons terminate in the lower central layer (layer 3) [6], whereas nociceptive class IV md neurons terminate in the ventral-most layer (layer 4).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.62">Class IV md neurons can be identified with ppkEGFP, which labels one intersegmental nerve (ISN) and two segmental nerve (SN) neurons in each hemisegment [9],[12].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.63">The position of termination in the neuropile does not correlate with the nerve route by which the sensory neurons reach the neuropile (see Figure S1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.64">Sensory axons whose cell bodies are located ventrally in the body wall travel in the SN, whereas axons whose cell bodies are located dorsally or laterally in the body wall travel in the ISN [13].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.65">Sensory axons running in the SN and ISN terminate in layers 2, 3, or 4, in correlation with their modality and dendritic morphology [9],[11].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.66">Since each of the three modality-specific sensory termination domains contains some neurons that have travelled through the SN, and

Zoghbi and Orr, 2000).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.14">Although Htt is ubiquitously expressed in the brain, HD mainly affects medium-sized spiny neurons in the striatum and to a lesser extent cortical pyramidal neurons that project to the striatum, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that other cellular factors also contribute to pathogenesis (Cattaneo et al., 2001; Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">Recent studies <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicate</ccue> that an alteration of wild-type Htt function <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue> contribute to this specificity and to subsequent disease progression (Cattaneo et al., 2001).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">For example, mutant Htt can sequester wild-type Htt into insoluble aggregates, thereby exerting a dominant negative effect (Huang et al., 1998; Kazantsev et al., 1999; Narain et al., 1999; Preisinger et al., 1999; Wheeler et al., 2000).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">In addition, wild-type Htt can suppress the cell death induced by mutant polyQ-expanded Htt in vitro (Leavitt et al., 2001;

which identical copies of the replicated genome are distributed to the products of each cell division, involves a highly dynamic sequence of coordinated motility events, mediated by a bipolar protein machine, the mitotic spindle (Karsenti and Vernos, 2001 ; Mitchison and Salmon, 2001 ; Gadde and Heald, 2004 ; Wadsworth and Khodjakov, 2004 ; Mogilner et al., 2006 ; Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2007 ; Walczak and Heald, 2008 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.12">These motility events are driven by molecular-scale forces generated by mitotic kinesins and dyneins, together with dynamic microtubules (MTs), whose activities are controlled by a network of regulatory proteins, e.g., mitotic kinases, phosphatases, and proteolytic enzymes (Sharp et al., 2000c ; Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2004 ; Maiato and Sunkel, 2004 ; Rogers et al., 2005 ; Goshima et al., 2007 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.13">Among these mitotic proteins, the kinesin-5 motor is <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">thought</ccue> to play a key role (Cottingham et al., 1999 ; Valentine et al., 2006a ; Civelekoglu-Scholey and Scholey, 2007 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.14">Purified kinesin-5 is a slow, modestly processive, plus-end–directed bipolar homotetramer capable of cross-linking adjacent MTs and sliding apart antiparallel MTs in motility assays (Sawin et al., 1992 ; Cole et al., 1994 ; Kashina et al., 1996a ; Kapitein et al., 2005 ; Tao et al., 2006 ; Valentine et al., 2006b ; Krzysiak et al., 2008 ; Van den Wildenberg et al., 2008 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">In yeast cells the homotetrameric structure of kinesin-5 <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">appears</ccue> to be essential for mitosis (Hildebrandt et al., 2006 ), and in Drosophila embryos KLP61F displays dynamic properties consistent with an association with spindle MTs (Cheerambathur et al., 2008 ) and forms presumptive MT–MT cross-bridges (Sharp et al., 1999a ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">These results <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that ensembles of multiple kinesin-5 motors <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue> serve as dynamic cross-links that organize spindle MTs into bundles and drive a sliding filament mechanism that pushes apart antiparallel spindle MTs (Sharp et al., 1999a ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ), although alternative mechanisms of action for kinesin-5 motors have also been proposed (Kapoor and Mitchison, 2001 ; Tsai et al., 2006 ; Johansen and Johansen, 2007 ; Gardner et al., 2008 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">The most obvious and frequently observed consequence of loss of activity of kinesin-5 motors, induced by loss-of-function mutation, antibody inhibition, small molecule inhibition, or RNA interference, is the formation of abnormal monoastral spindles (Enos and Morris, 1990 ; Saunders and Hoyt, 1992 ; Sawin et al., 1992 ; Heck et al., 1993 ; Saunders et al., 1997 ; Cottingham et al., 1999 ; Mayer et al., 1999 ; Sharp et al., 1999b ; Sharp et al., 2000a ; Goshima and Vale, 2003 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">This <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggests</ccue> that kinesin-5 <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> normally contribute to spindle bipolarity by sliding apart interpolar (ip) MTs to drive spindle pole separation during mitotic spindle assembly, elongation and function.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">(Saunders and Hoyt, 1992 ; Sawin et al., 1992 ; Heck et al., 1993 ; Saunders et al., 1997 ; Straight et al., 1998 ; Walczak et al., 1998 ; Sharp et al., 2000a ; Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ; Cheerambathur et al., 2007 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">It is clear that this activity is deployed differently in different systems, however.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">For example, kinesin-5 activity is required for initial spindle assembly in yeast but not in Drosophila embryos, whereas it is required for spindle maintenance in both systems (Saunders and Hoyt, 1992 ; Sharp et al., 1999b ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Inhibition of kinesin-5 in different systems has also resulted in defects in poleward flux (Miyamoto et al., 2004 ; Cameron et al., 2006 ) and spindle pole organization (Gaglio et al., 1996 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">However, in Drosophila S2 cells, perturbation of kinesin-5 levels did not interfere with metaphase spindle length (Goshima et al., 2005b ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">In Caenorhabditis elegans, kinesin-5 was also found to exert a braking effect on the spindle midzone that governs the rate of spindle elongation mediated by cortical motors (Saunders et al., 2007 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">It is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">unclear</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">if</ccue> these findings are relevant to all spindles and <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">if</ccue> they all reflect the antiparallel MT sliding activity of kinesin-5, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">if</ccue> kinesin-5 functions differently in different systems as <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">implied</ccue> by the <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">proposal</ccue> that kinesin-5 functions as a MT depolymerase rather than a sliding motor to control chromosome congression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Gardner et al., 2008 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">To distinguish these possibilities, therefore, systematic studies of kinesin-5 function throughout mitosis are needed, but this is difficult because the most frequently observed effect of perturbing kinesin-5 function, spindle collapse, obscures later effects in mitosis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">In Drosophila embryos, where the centrosomes dictate the assembly of remarkably dynamic, fast-acting spindles (Megraw et al., 2001 ; Cheerambathur et al., 2007 ), inhibiting the function of the kinesin-5, KLP61F produced collapsed monoastral spindles at a specific stage during prometaphase, and this was rescued by loss of function of the kinesin-14, Ncd (Sharp et al., 1999b , 2000a ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">Biochemical evidence supports the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">idea</ccue> that the prometaphase spindle is maintained by a KLP61F-Ncd force balance (Tao et al., 2006 ), but it is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">unclear</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">if</ccue> the monoastral spindles form by the drawing together of focused poles due to Ncd-induced inward MT sliding <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> by the disorganization of spindle MTs combined with the fusion of microtubule organizing centers (Goshima and Vale, 2003 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">We previously <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">proposed</ccue> that the KLP61F-driven outward sliding of ipMTs drives pre-anaphase B poleward flux and anaphase B spindle elongation (Brust-Mascher and Scholey, 2002 ; Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">However, reductionist modeling (Brust-Mascher et al., 2004 ) and system level modeling (Wollman et al., 2008 ) surprisingly <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">predicted</ccue> that the rate of anaphase B pole–pole separation is insensitive to the KLP61F concentration and is controlled instead by the unloaded KLP61F MT sliding velocity together with a pole-associated MT depolymerase.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Although experimental evidence supports a requirement for KLP61F activity in anaphase B (Sharp et al., 2000a ), we had not <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">tested</ccue> the effect of changing its concentration on the rate of anaphase B or its contribution to poleward flux and metaphase spindle length.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Furthermore, it is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">unclear</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">if</ccue> some of these activities also require the activity of the overlying cortex, e.g., via cortical motors pulling astral MTs outward.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">In the current study we addressed some of these uncertainties by undertaking a systematic investigation of the spectrum of mitotic functions of kinesin-5, through antibody-induced dissociation of KLP61F from Drosophila syncytial blastoderm-stage embryo spindles, using an experimental system where the extent of dissociation can be directly observed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">This was complemented by studies of the effects of varying the KLP61F gene dosage

2C).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.131">The most severe effect, prometaphase spindle collapse, occurred at a rate of 0.06 µm/s (Figure 1B, spindles s5 and s6), although some spindles close by retained sufficient levels of KLP61F to slow down the rate of collapse (Figure 2C, spindles s1–s4).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.132">Further away, spindles were observed to shorten somewhat, but did not

levels of the ADA substrates adenosine and deoxyadenosine, both of which are biologically active purines that can have a deep impact on cellular physiology.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">Adenosine is
