id="S1.1">Electroacoustic music</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.2">Many date the formal birth of electroacoustic music to the late 1940s and early 1950s, and in particular to the work of two groups of composers whose aesthetic orientations were radically opposed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.3">The Musique concrete group was centered in Paris and was pioneered by Pierre Schaeffer; their music was based on the juxtaposition and transformation of natural sounds (meaning real, recorded sounds, not necessarily those made by natural forces) recorded to tape or disc.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.4">In Cologne, 'elektronische Musik', pioneered in 1949–51 by the composer Herbert Eimert and the physicist Werner Meyer-Eppler, was based solely on electronically generated (synthetic) sounds, particularly sine waves (Ungeheuer 1992).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.5">The precise control afforded by the studio allowed for what Eimert <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">considered</ccue> to be an electronic extension and perfection of serialism; in the studio, serial operations could be applied to elements such as timbre and dynamics.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">The common link between the two schools is that the music is recorded and performed through loudspeakers, without a human performer.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.7">While serialism has been largely abandoned in electroacoustic circles, the majority of electroacoustic pieces use a combination of recorded sound and synthesized or processed sounds, and the schism between Schaeffer's and Eimert's approaches has been overcome, the first major example being Karlheinz Stockhausen's 'Gesang der Jünglinge' of

the JPEG still-picture coding standard, there is no document that defines a single exact format that is universally recognized as a complete specification of “Motion JPEG” for use in all contexts.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.3">This raises compatibility concerns about file outputs from different manufacturers.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.4">The format has a relatively high bit rate for

1990s, technology improvements have made intraframe compression possible.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">The JPEG organization itself has developed a new design called JPEG 2000, and other types of such technology improvements can be found in the designs of H.263v2 Annex I and MPEG-4 Part 2, which use frequency-domain prediction of transform coefficient values, and in H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which uses spatial prediction and adaptive transform block size techniques and more sophisticated entropy coding than what was practical when the first JPEG design was developed.</Sentence><Sentence

mocked and condemned for centuries for being victims of spousal abuse.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.4">After the Renaissance era in Europe, battered men were punished and deemed failures in society.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.5">In England for example, men would be strapped to carts and driven around town, while people sat and ridiculed them.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">Much like our society today, the topic of abused men is taken as a joke instead of a serious issue.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.7">Some of the reasons why the issue has not been taken seriously is because the ratio of male versus female victims, the methods used to <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">determine</ccue> <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether or not</ccue> male victimization has occurred, and the nature of female violence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.8">The means used to measure domestic violence strongly influence the results found.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.9">For example, studies of reported domestic violence and extrapolations of those studies show women preponderantly as victims and men to be more violent, whereas the statistical survey based Conflict Tactics Scale, tends to show men and women equally violent.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.10">This stereotype has been embedded in social standards for decades that it is unimaginable that it would ever occur the other way around.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.11">The nature of female violence has also been <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">questioned</ccue>.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.12">Studies show that women act violently against men as a means of self defense <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">probably</ccue> because of the fact that they were previously victims

their male spouse when using a knife, object, or gun.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">It is women that tend to be the first to reach for something that can cause serious fatalities to their partner.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">Another reason why the issue has not been taken seriously is the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">belief</ccue> that the study of battered women will help provide information on battered men.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">It <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggests</ccue> that the few cases that have been reported by men, have had their social and legal needs already met.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">Many other reasons why domestic violence has gone unrecognized for years is because of several other reasons, such as: violence against men is so low that it is hard to get a correct estimate as to how many men are actually abused.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">It has taken women several years to encourage each other to report domestic violence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">While no action has been taken by men to report spousal abuse.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">The <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic

only other keyboard layout registered with ANSI and is provided with all major operating systems, attempts to convert universally to the Dvorak layout have not succeeded.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.3">The failure of the Dvorak layout to displace the QWERTY layout has been the subject of some studies and of considerable debate.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.4">However, in considering resistance to the adoption of the Dvorak layout, different segments of the market (non-typists, typists, corporations and manufacturers) differ in the extent, nature, and motivation of their resistance.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.5">Furthermore, the influence of these factors on the different segments of the market has changed over time, following changes in technology and awareness of Dvorak as an alternative keyboard layout.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">Factors against adoption of the Dvorak layout have included the following:</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.7">Failure to demonstrate superiority in speed, economy of effort, and accuracy--noting that the significant issue here is the demonstrability.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.8">Few studies have been done on the relative efficiency of the two keyboard layouts, and those studies have been criticised for failing to adhere to rigorous academic standards.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.9">Failure to achieve the general population's awareness that the Dvorak layout existed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.10">This improved somewhat following the 'Guinness Book of Records' 1985 publication of Barbara Blackburn’s achievement of 212 wpm using a Dvorak keyboard, and again in the mid-1990s when computer operating systems began to incorporate the Dvorak layout as an option.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.11">Failure to overcome an investment in competence in the QWERTY layout made by a large number of typists and typist trainers prior to the general availability of the Dvorak layout.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.12">This investment has proved the most powerful influence up until the 1990s.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.13">Typing training in schools and secretarial colleges is almost always done on the QWERTY layout both because it conforms with the expectation of industry and because it is the layout with which most teachers or trainers are already familiar.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.14">Many QWERTY typists have retrained themselves to use the Dvorak layout because the emphasis in touch typing is traditionally on speed and accuracy, and because Dvorak users commonly report a reduction in typing-related injuries such as carpal-tunnel syndrome.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">A reduction in efficiency while learning the Dvorak layout further impedes its adoption by typists already competent with QWERTY, and the organizations that employ them---although it has been claimed that on average, typists who switch to Dvorak require just two to three weeks' use to surpass their former typing speeds.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">Failure to persuade large typewriter manufacturers to produce significant volumes of typewriters equipped with Dvorak layouts.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">It would be sufficient to argue that the manufacturers were responding to the large QWERTY user base, rather than considering the plausible but unproven assertion that manufacturers had a vested interest in ensuring that typists could not type faster than the machines could respond mechanically.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">Converting standard mechanical typewriters to Dvorak (or any alternative, e.g. international, layout) was often impractical, and at best expensive, so switching to Dvorak usually required a new, dedicated machine.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">A notable exception was the popular IBM Selectric typewriter, which used a single spherical typing element rather than individual character hammers; it could easily be converted by replacing the QWERTY typing
