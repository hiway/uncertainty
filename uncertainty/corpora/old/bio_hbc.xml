id="S1.15">Introduction</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.16">The clinical spectrum of P. falciparum infection ranges from asymptomatic parasite carriage to a febrile disease that <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> develop into a severe, life-threatening illness.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">The factors that determine disease severity are <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">not completely understood</ccue> but are <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">likely</ccue> to include both parasite and host components [1]–[3].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">Ultimately, the interplay between the parasite and the immune response <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">likely</ccue> determines the outcome of the infection [4].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">Although sterile immunity - completely preventing re-infection - is hardly ever seen and protection against clinical symptoms of uncomplicated disease is only acquired after repeated infections [5], immunity to severe disease and death <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be acquired after as few as one or two infections [6] <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that different immune mechanisms underlie these different levels of immunity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">While there is a growing consensus that killing of malaria parasites or malaria-infected red blood cells requires the synergistic action of antibodies and cell-mediated immune responses [5],[7], the mechanisms conferring protection against severe disease are <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">less clear</ccue>.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">Given that pathology of severe disease has repeatedly been linked to sustained and/or excessive inflammatory responses [4], acquiring the ability to regulate these responses adequately <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be a key determinant of immunity that protects against severe disease [8].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Thus, while an early inflammatory response is needed to control parasite replication in human P. falciparum malaria [9]–[11], excessive levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α [12]–[15], IFN-γ, [16],[17], IL-1ß and IL-6 [14],[18],[19] are associated with severe pathology.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Conversely, low levels of regulatory cytokines such as TGF-ß have been associated with acute [20] and severe malaria [21],[22], a relative deficiency in IL-10 was seen in those who succumbed to severe malaria [23], significantly lower ratios of IL-10 to TNF-α were found in patients with severe malarial anaemia [24],[25], and high ratios of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-12 to TGF-ß or IL-10 were associated with decreased risk of malaria but increased risk of clinical disease in those who became infected [26].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">In summary, therefore, immunity against severe malaria <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> depend upon the host's ability to regulate the magnitude and timing of the cellular immune response, allowing the sequential induction of appropriate levels of inflammatory- and anti-inflammatory cytokines at key stages of the infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">Given these associations between severe disease and exacerbated immune pathology, a number of studies have <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">explored</ccue> the role of CD4+CD25hiFOXP3+CD127-/lo regulatory T cells (Tregs) in determining the outcome of malaria infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">Induced and/or activated in response to malaria infection [27], Tregs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be beneficial to the host in the later part of the infection - when parasitaemia is being cleared - by down-regulating the inflammatory response and thereby preventing immune-mediated pathology.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">On the other hand, <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">if</ccue> Tregs mediate their suppressive effects too early, this <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">could</ccue> hamper the responses required for initial control of parasitaemia, permitting unbridled parasite growth which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> also lead to severe disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">Malaria-specific induction of Tregs has been observed in a variety of experimental malaria infections in mice [28]–[31], but their role in preventing severe malarial pathology is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">unclear</ccue>.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Thus, in BALB/c mice infected with a lethal strain of P. yoelii, ablation of Treg activity by depletion of CD25+ cells either allowed mice to control parasitaemia and survive [32] or had no impact on the course of disease [33].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Depleting CD25+ cells of BALB/c mice infected with either P. berghei NK65 [34] or P berghei ANKA [35] reduced neither parasitaemia nor mortality, but increased the severity of symptoms in the diseased mice, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> at least some benefit from Tregs in this model.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Rather oddly, infection of CD25+ T cell-depleted BALB/c mice with P. chabaudi adami DS led to increased parasitaemia and more severe anaemia [30].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Finally, CD25+ T cell depletion around the time of parasite inoculation reduced the incidence of experimental cerebral malaria in C57BL/6 mice infected with P. berghei ANKA in two independent studies [29],[31], but not when CD25+ T cells were depleted 30 days prior to infection [31].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">Whilst various explanations have been offered for these discrepant results, including differences in the various strains of mice and parasites employed, the microbial microenvironment in which the mice are kept, and the precise CD25 depletion protocols employed, these studies are currently not very helpful when trying to understand the role of Tregs in human malaria infections.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">Malaria naive individuals undergoing experimental P. falciparum sporozoite infection showed an increase in FOXP3 mRNA expression and expansion of Tregs 10 days after infection; Treg induction correlated with high circulating levels of TGF-ß, low levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and rapid parasite growth [27] <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> - but not proving - that Treg activation early in infection <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> inhibit the development of effective cellular immunity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">More recently, we have observed that Treg populations <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">appear</ccue> to be transiently expanded and activated during the malaria transmission season in individuals from a malaria endemic community [36], again <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that naturally acquired malaria infection <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> drive the expansion and activation of Tregs.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.36">However, although Tregs have been implicated in IL-10-mediated down-regulation of Th1-like responses in the placenta of malaria-infected women [37] and reduced Treg frequencies and function have been linked to enhanced anti-parasite immunity in certain ethnic groups in West Africa [38] the potential for Tregs to influence the clinical outcome of malaria infections is still <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">unclear</ccue>.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">To <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">investigate</ccue> the role of Tregs during clinical malaria infection, we have compared cellular immune responses of children with either severe or uncomplicated malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">Interestingly, although we did not observe any significant differences in Treg numbers or function between severe and uncomplicated malaria cases, our data do <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicate</ccue> that malaria-induced Tregs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> limit the magnitude of malaria-specific Th1 memory responses and thus moderate pro-inflammatory responses to subsequent infections, providing a <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue> explanation for the very rapid acquisition of immunity to severe malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">Moreover, we have identified a population of FOXP3-, CD45RO+, CD4+ T cells which co-produce IL-10 and IFN-γ and which are more prevalent in children with uncomplicated malaria than in those with severe disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">We <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that these IL-10 producing effector T cells <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> contribute to clearing malaria infection without-inducing immune-mediated pathology.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.41">Results</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.42">Immune responses of 59 Gambian children with severe P. falciparum malaria were compared with those of 65 children with uncomplicated clinical malaria and with 20 healthy (control) children of similar age and recruited from the same study area at the same time (Table 1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">On admission, only 12 (9.4%) patients had a white blood cell count (WBC) above the age-specific norm and there was no significant difference in median WBC count between uncomplicated and severe cases, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that few if any children had a concomitant systemic bacterial infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">No difference was observed in the differential WBC between the two groups.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">As expected, [39]–[41] numbers of lymphocytes, CD3+ and CD4+ T cells were significantly lower during the acute disease than during convalescence in both the severe and the uncomplicated groups (Table 1A).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">Parasite density on admission was two-fold higher in patients with severe malaria than in those with uncomplicated malaria; severely ill children also had significantly lower hemoglobin levels and were on average 2.4 years younger than children with uncomplicated disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">The number of P. falciparum clones per clinical isolate ranged from 1 to 4 (with an overall mean of 2 (CI95%: 1.8–2.1)), and – as has been observed previously [42] - did not differ significantly between the three groups (p=0.3, Table 1B).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">Other factors <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">potentially</ccue> confounding immune responses, such as the degree of malnutrition or intestinal helminth infections were of similarly low prevalence in both severe and uncomplicated malaria cases and were not associated with severity of disease (Table 1B).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="TableLegend"><Sentence id="S1.49">Characteristics of study participants (A) and distribution of potential confounding factors (B).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.50">For statistical analysis, patients were classified as uncomplicated or severe cases, with the latter being further subdivided into those patients suffering from cerebral malaria (CM), severe anaemia (SA) or severe respiratory distress (SRD) (grouped together as SA) and those suffering only from severe prostration (grouped as SB).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">Data were analysed using linear regression, with a random effect to allow for the within subject measurements over time, adjusting for age, sex, duration of prior symptoms and numbers of clones causing the infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.52">Due to the multiplicity of comparisons that were made within the model, resulting from multiple responses and multiple comparisons within response, hypotheses rejected with a probability of less than 0.012 have a false discovery rate of 5% [43].</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.53">Similar numbers and proportions of Tregs among uncomplicated and severe malaria cases, increasing during convalescence</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.54">We <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesized</ccue> that children with severe malaria would have fewer circulating Tregs than children with uncomplicated malaria, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">or</ccue> that Tregs of severely ill children would be less active than those of children with uncomplicated disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.55">However, the proportion of cells expressing a Treg phenotype (defined by flow cytometry as CD3+CD4+ lymphocytes being FOXP3+and CD127-/low; Figure 1A, 1B, and 1C) was similar in the acute (D0) and the convalescent phase (D28) for both uncomplicated and severe cases (SA+SB) and in healthy control children; on average, 2–3% of CD4+ T cells expressed the regulatory phenotype (Figure 1D).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.56">However, when the number of cells expressing a Treg phenotype was calculated using lymphocyte and monocyte counts from the differential WBC, we found that the absolute numbers of Tregs (per litre of blood) were significantly and similarly elevated in both severe and uncomplicated malaria cases during convalescence when compared to the acute phase (p&lt;0.001) or when compared to the control group of healthy children (p=0.037) (Figure 1E).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.57">A similar kinetic was observed for FOXP3 mRNA levels (Figure 1F).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.58">Similar number and proportion of Tregs in uncomplicated and severe disease, increasing during convalescence.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.59">Although not supportive of our original hypothesis, these observations are consistent with the notion that acute malaria infection drives expansion of Treg populations which then persist for some weeks to maintain immune homeostasis during the contraction phase of the effector response [36].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.60">In accordance with this notion, and in agreement with our previous observation that increased levels of Tregs were associated with faster parasite growth during the early stages of blood stage infection [27], we observe here in - children with either severe or uncomplicated malaria infections - a significant positive correlation between parasite density and the frequency of Tregs within the CD4+ T cell population (p=0.002, Figure 2).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.61">Proportion of T cells

severe and uncomplicated malaria were <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">analysed</ccue> for expression of CD45RO (Figure 3A and 3B).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.64">In both uncomplicated and severe cases, the proportion of all T cells expressing CD45RO was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) during acute infection than during convalescence (data not shown).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.65">Irrespective of disease severity, more than 90% of Tregs expressed CD45RO during the acute phase of infection but expression of this marker decreased significantly (to approx 70%) during convalescence (Figure 3C).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.66">Likewise, the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD45RO staining was 1.5 fold higher (p=0.0025) during acute disease than during convalescence (Figure 3D).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.67">Taken together, these data <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicate</ccue> that in both uncomplicated and severe cases of malaria Tregs are predominantly of a memory phenotype and are activated during acute malaria infection.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.68">Tregs display an

patients</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.70">Three different indicators were used to assess the regulatory potential of Tregs during acute malaria infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.71">Firstly, using a classical anti-CD25 depletion assay, we assessed the ability of Tregs to suppress P. falciparum shizont extract (PfSE)-driven lymphocyte proliferation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.72">Anti CD25 treatment removed approximately half (geometric mean 48.8%; CI95%: 41–58%) of the CD4+ T cells that were FOXP3+CD127-/low and this was associated with a 1.76 fold and 1.57-fold (geometric means) increase in PfSE-induced lymphoproliferation in severe and uncomplicated cases, respectively, with no significant difference between the groups (p=0.343, Figure 4A).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="FigureLegend"><Sentence id="S1.73">Tregs from severe and uncomplicated cases have similar functional capacity.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.74">Next, since reduced expression of SOCS-2, a member of the suppressors of cytokine signaling family confined to Tregs [45], has been linked to impaired Treg function in Africans [38] we compared SOCS-2 mRNA levels among severe and uncomplicated cases.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.75">While SOCS-2 levels were found to be significantly reduced during acute disease compared to convalescence (p=0.0076), no difference was observed between those with severe and those with uncomplicated malaria (data not shown).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.76">Finally, since high concentrations of TNF-α have been reported to impair Treg activity (by upregulating and then signaling via TNFR2, leading to decreased FOXP3 mRNA and protein expression [46]), and the functional impairment of Tregs observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients can be reversed by anti-TNF-α antibodies [47], we considered the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesis</ccue> that the high levels of TNF-α seen in severe malaria patients [13],[15], <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue> upregulate TNFR2 and impair Treg function.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.77">TNFR2 expression on Tregs was assessed by flow cytometry (Figure 4B and 4C).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.78">However, although a significantly higher proportion of Tregs expressed TNFR2 (Figure 4D) - with higher MFI (data not shown, p=0.028) - during acute disease compared to convalescence, no difference was seen in TNFR2 expression on Tregs between severe and uncomplicated cases (Figure 4D).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.79">Moreover, there was no correlation between plasma levels of TNF-α and TNFR2 expression on Tregs, neither among severe or uncomplicated cases nor among all cases combined; neither did we observe any inverse correlation between TNF-α concentration and FOXP3 expression.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.80">Rather, the MFI of TNFR2 on Tregs was positively correlated with the MFI of FOXP3 in Tregs (r: 0.476; p&lt;0.0001).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.81">Thus, our data <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">seem</ccue> to be more in line with data from mice <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that the interaction of TNF-α with TNFR2 on Tregs promotes their expansion and upregulation of FOXP3 [48] than with the data from studies of human rheumatoid arthritis.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SubSectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.82">Stronger Th-1 responses observed in severe compared to uncomplicated cases are balanced by IL-10</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.83">Since the balance of T-effector to Treg responses is <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">likely</ccue> to be as important, or more important, than the absolute levels of either [26], we compared the ratio of the levels of mRNA for the Th1 transcription factor T-BET with those for FOXP3, currently <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">considered</ccue> the best marker for Tregs, and the ratio of T-effector cells (defined as CD3+CD4+CD25+FOXP3-, T-effector) over Tregs among the various groups.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.84">As shown in Figure 5A, in all groups the T-BET/FOXP3 ratio was significantly higher during acute disease than during convalescence and a similar, albeit not significant, trend was observed for the ratio of T-effector/Tregs (data not shown).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.85">Moreover, since the absolute number of circulating T-effector cells was significantly higher in severe cases than in uncomplicated cases (p=0.01, data not shown), the T-effector/Treg ratio tended to be higher among severe cases than uncomplicated cases on day 0 (p=0.039) and a similar trend was seen for the T-BET/FOXP3 ratio (p=0.058).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.86">The ratio of FOXP3 to GATA-3 (Th2 lineage factor) mRNA was similar for both time points in all groups (data not shown) but the Th1/Th2 ratio (T-BET/GATA-3 mRNA) was significantly higher during acute disease in children with CM, SA or SRD compared to those suffering from severe prostration (p=0.0075), <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicating</ccue> that the expansion of the T-effector population is biased towards Th1

cytokines.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.88">These data confirm previous studies <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicating</ccue> a shift towards a more inflammatory response during acute and severe malaria but, significantly, our data extend the previous observations by revealing that this inflammation is not balanced by a commensurate increase in Treg function.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.89">Indeed, our data strongly <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that the potent inflammation induced during an acute malaria infection overwhelms the normal homeostatic capacity of the immune system and, in particular, that the Treg response in children with severe malaria is insufficient to balance a much stronger Th1 effector response.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.90">To <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">investigate</ccue> further the dynamics of pro-inflammatory/regulatory responses during clinical malaria, plasma concentrations and mRNA transcripts of inflammatory (IFN-γ, TNF-α) and regulatory cytokines (IL-10) were assayed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.91">In accordance with previous observations, plasma concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 were all significantly higher during acute disease than during convalescence, with significantly higher levels in severely ill children compared to

cytokines ratios between children with differing levels of disease severity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.96">Thus, the ratios of TNF-α or IFN-γ to IL-10 on day 0 were similar in all disease severity groups (Figure 5E and 5F) and ratios of IFN-γ to IL-10 mRNA were similar in all disease severity groups both on day 0 and day 28 (Figure S1F).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.97">However, IFN-γ mRNA levels

type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesized</ccue> that the balance of inflammatory to regulatory immune responses would be biased towards a more inflammatory response in children with severe malaria than in children with uncomplicated malaria, that this balance would be restored during convalescence and – crucially – that this would be associated with differences in the proportion, absolute number or function of circulating classical (CD4+ CD127-/lo FOXP3+) regulatory T cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.120">In partial support of these hypotheses, the number of cells expressing a Treg phenotype and FOXP3-mRNA levels were both significantly higher during convalescence than during the acute clinical episode and the ratio of the Th1 transcription factor T-BET to the Treg transcription factor FOXP3 was significantly higher during acute disease than during convalescence in both severe and uncomplicated cases, compatible with the notion that Tregs fail to sufficiently regulate pro-inflammatory responses which <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue> contribute to the onset of symptomatic malaria infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.121">Given our previous observation of Treg expansion during the pre-patent phase of malaria infection [27], we <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that Tregs are induced/activated shortly after parasite emergence from the liver, that their numbers in peripheral blood then decline as a result of sequestration of CD4+ T cells during acute disease [40],[41],[56] and then, as has been described for other T cell subsets [39],[57], Tregs regain access to the circulation after malaria is cured.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.122">The significant positive correlation of Treg numbers with parasitaemia, as well as the correlation between FOXP3 mRNA and IFN-γ mRNA levels in acute samples, further supports the notion that the initial infection induces a proportional increase in Tregs, attempting to balance the effector T cell response, and is in line with the recently proposed <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">concept</ccue> that antigenic challenge will give rise to an antigen specific Treg response, proportional in size to the inflammatory response [58].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.123">Moreover, the Tregs circulating during acute malaria infections almost exclusively expressed an activated memory phenotype <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that they have expanded from a pre-existing pool of memory T-cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.124">This interpretation <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">would</ccue> be in line with recent elegant work in humans demonstrating that Tregs are derived by rapid turnover of memory populations in vivo [59], and with data from murine studies where, after CD25-depletion, malaria infection very rapidly drives differentiation of Tregs from circulating mature CD4+ T cells [60].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.125">Obviously, it <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">would</ccue> be of interest to <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">study</ccue> the relationship between Tregs and effector T cell kinetics and parasite biomass, which is not readily measurable.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.126">Future studies <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> explore the usefulness of P. falciparum Histidine Rich Protein 2 in this context, which has recently been <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggested</ccue> as a surrogate marker for parasite biomass [61].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.127">However, despite clear evidence of Treg induction and reallocation during acute malaria infection, we could not find any robust differences in Treg parameters between children with severe and uncomplicated disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.128">Thus, neither Treg numbers nor FOXP3 mRNA levels differed significantly between children with uncomplicated malaria and those with severe malaria, and three different indicators of Treg function - their capacity to suppress lymphoproliferation, their expression of SOCS-2 [45] and TNFR2 [46],[48] were all similar in severely ill children and children with uncomplicated disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.129">Furthermore, the similar distortion in the T-BET/FOXP3 mRNA ratio during acute disease and the lack of any marked differences between the two groups in ratios of inflammatory to anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the close correlation between IFN-γ and IL-10 in both groups which is in line with previous observations in experimental human malaria infections [62], <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggests</ccue> that the systemic shift towards a pro-inflammatory immune response is similar in children with either severe or uncomplicated disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.130">At first glance, these data do not <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">appear</ccue> to support the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesis</ccue> that deficiencies in Treg function underlie the tendency of some children to develop severe, life threatening malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.131">However, we did observe significantly higher Th1 effector responses (more T-effector cells, higher concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α) in severely ill children than in children with uncomplicated disease, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that the classical FOXP3+ Treg response that develops during acute malaria infection <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be insufficient to balance the florid effector T cell response that develops particularly in children with severe disease.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.132">This <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">would</ccue> be in line with evidence showing that as the strength of the inflammatory stimulus increases, the suppressive capacity of human Tregs declines and the resistance of T-effector cells to regulation increases [63].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.133">The situation observed during an acute, clinical malaria infection is thus in clear contrast to the situation in healthy, malaria-exposed individuals where Treg numbers closely track numbers of T-effectors, precisely maintaining an apparently optimal T-effectorTreg ratio [36].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.134">IL-10 is well-established as a vital homeostatic regulator of malaria-induced inflammation that prevents immune-pathology in mice [49],[64], promotes the necessary switch from early Th1 to subsequent Th2 responses [65],[66], and has been linked to protection from severe malaria anaemia [24],[25], and death [23] in humans.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.135">However, the cellular source of IL-10 in human malaria cases was, until now, ill defined.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.136">Contrary to our expectations, but in striking agreement with observations in P. yoelii-infected mice [33], CD45RO+ CD4+ T cells (that are CD25- and FOXP3-) and not classical Tregs are the only substantial source of IL-10 during acute malaria infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.137">This observation is reminiscent of that made by Nylen [67] in patients with acute visceral leishmaniasis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.138">Moreover, in our patients, a significant proportion of IL-10 producing CD4+ T cells were simultaneously producing IFN-γ, identifying them as Th1 cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.139">Although IL-10 secreting Th1 cells have been described recently in two murine models of toxoplasmosis [50], and cutaneous leishmaniasis [51], as far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration of IL-10 producing Th1 cells during human infections.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.140">Intriguingly, the proportion of these cells within the total CD4+ T cell population was significantly higher in children with uncomplicated malaria than in children with severe malaria <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that in human P. falciparum infection, as in murine T.gondii infections [50], IL-10 producing Th1 cells, activated by a strong inflammatory stimulus, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> act as anti-parasitic effector cells with a “built in” control mechanism to prevent the onset of immune pathology.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.141"><ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">If</ccue> so, then the ability of these self-regulating effector cells to localize to sites of parasite sequestration in tissues, where they mediate parasite killing whilst simultaneously blocking tissue damage, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be key to clinical immunity to malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.142">Thus, our data strongly <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggest</ccue> that the percentage of IL-10-producing Th1 effector cells, rather than the cocktail of circulating cytokines, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be the most relevant biomarker of effective immunity to severe malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.143">Although (Tregs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> not <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">seem</ccue> to determine the outcome of current P. falciparum infections) we did find evidence that they affect the magnitude of the malaria specific memory response induced by the current infection.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.144">A similar observation has been made in P. berghei ANKA-infected mice; animals that were depleted of CD25+ cells prior to infection and drug-cured on day 5 developed significantly stronger IFN-γ memory responses on day 14 than did intact infected/cured mice, and these mice also developed much more severe, and frequently fatal, clinical symptoms upon reinfection, despite more efficient parasite clearance [35].</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.145">Thus, malaria specific Tregs acquired during a primary infection <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> limit the magnitude of Th1 effector responses to subsequent infections to a level that allows parasite clearance without causing immunopathology.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.146">Future studies should be designed to <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">test</ccue> the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">hypothesis</ccue> that Tregs <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> contribute to the very rapid development of resistance to severe malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.147">In summary, our data <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicate</ccue> that classical FOXP3+ Tregs are unable to control the florid inflammation that accompanies acute malaria infections and this component of the immunoregulatory arsenal is rapidly overwhelmed in children with either mild or severe malaria.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.148">Importantly however we have identified, for the first time in an acute human infection, a population of IL-10 producing Th1 effector cells which <ccue

id="S1.4">One new lineage, which has come to be called Th17 cells, selectively produces proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-17 (IL-17, A and F), IL-21, and IL-22.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.5">In conjunction with transforming growth factor ß-1 (TGFß-1), IL-6, IL-21, and IL-23, which activate the transcription factor, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3), the expression of another transcription factor, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor-γt (RORγt) leads to the differentiation of Th17 cells in mice.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">Other cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-27 inhibit Th17 differentiation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.7">However, IL-2 acting with TGFß-1 induces differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells to become

humans.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.11">Keywords: Th17 cells, autoimmune diseases, inflammation, IL-17, Rheumatoid arthritis</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.12">Introduction</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.13">It is well-established that the innate immune response leads to activation of adaptive immunity, shaping the proper response, depending upon the pathogen eliciting the reaction.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.14">Conversely, though, it is also clear that adaptive immune response, especially, CD4+ or helper T cells orchestrate responses to effectively eliminate pathogens.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">Classically, helper T cells were considered to differentiate into two lineages, T helper 1 (Th1) cells or Th2 cells (1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">In addition to ligation of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory receptors, a suitable cytokine milieu is required for fate decision of helper T cells (1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">In particular, interleukin-12 (IL-12), which is produced by activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs), promotes Th1 differentiation (2), whereas IL-4, produced by activated T cells and some innate immune cells, drives Th2 differentiation (1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">While the Th1/Th2 paradigm provided invaluable insights for immunologists, its limitations were also clear.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">What was the most obvious was the inability of this dichotomy to explain autoimmune diseases.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">More recent studies have shown the existence of the additional subpopulations of T helper cells that are also important in immunoregulation and host defense.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">One important subset is CD4+CD25+, regulatory T cells (Tregs) (3, 4).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Tregs suppress the proliferation and function of effector T cells, and attenuate immune responses against self or nonself-antigens (3, 4).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">Another recently identified new fate of T cells is Th17 cells that selectively produce IL-17 (A and F) (5, 6).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">In the past three years, discoveries pertaining to this newly identified T helper subset in humans and mice have accumulated with tremendous speed (7-10).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">It is also clear that the notion of a single type of Th17 cell <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> not be correct, as there <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">seems</ccue> to be further complexity in terms of the cytokines produced by these cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">In this review, we will discuss the historical developments that led to a new understanding of the role of T cells in autoimmune diseases and recent advances that have led to even newer insights into T cell biology.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence

type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">thought</ccue> that answer fit well with the standard Th1/Th2 cells paradigm (11).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Th1 cells produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and lymphotoxin, and are responsible for protection against intracellular pathogens such as viruses, mycobacteria, and protozoa (11).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Produced by activated APCs, IL-12 activates the transcription factor, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 4 (Stat4) (2).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Stat4-dependent signaling in conjunction with TCR-dependent signals induces the expression of T-box-expressed-in-T-cells (T-bet), the so-called master regulator of Th1 differentiation (2).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Recently, in humans, it has been shown that STAT4 polymorphisms are associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (12).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">IFN-γ also activates Stat1 which further induces T-bet to form an autocrine feedback loop for IFN-γ production (2).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">T-bet promotes not only IFN-γ production but also suppression of Th2 cytokines production by T cells (2).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">On the other hand, Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.36">IL-4 activates Stat6, which up-regulates the expression of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA-3) (1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">Th2 cytokines are potent activators of B-cell Immunoglobulin E production, eosinophil recruitment, and mucosal expulsion mechanisms, and are essential for promoting host defense against helminths and other parasites (1).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">In addition, Th2 cells have been shown to mediate allergic diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis (11).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">Traditionally, autoimmune diseases had been <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">assumed</ccue> to be associated with dysregulated Th1 responses (13).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">Because the treatment with anti-IL-12p40 antibody was effective in Crohn's disease (CD) and psoriasis (14, 15), it was further <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">assumed</ccue> that IL-12-mediated IFN-γ production and Th1 response were involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">However, it was shown that IFN-γ deficiency exacerbated rather than ameliorated mouse models of autoimmune diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (16).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42">Subsequently, a new cytokine, which consists of IL-23p19 and IL-12p40, was identified and termed IL-23 (17).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">Interestingly, the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) forms dimers with the IL-12Rß1 chain shared by IL-12 and IL-23 (18).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.44">IL-23R is predominantly expressed on T and natural killer (NK) cells (18, 19).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">IL-23 activates Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2), which in turn leads to activation of Stat1, Stat3, Stat4, and Stat5, among which Stat3 is the predominant factor phosphorylated by this cytokine (17, 18).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">Of note, IL-23p19-deficient mice or IL-12p40-deficient (IL-12/IL-23-deficient) mice were resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and EAE (20, 21).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">However, IL-12p35-deficient mice had increased susceptibility to CIA and EAE (20, 21).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">These studies directly negated the pathogenic role of the IL-12/IFN-γ axis in autoimmunity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">This was an important piece of information that led to the unraveling of the Th1/Th2 paradigm as an explanation of autoimmunity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">Accordingly, additional studies on IL-23p19-deficient mice and the anti-IL-23p19 antibody revealed that IL-23, but not IL-12, was the culprit in autoimmunity, at least in mouse disease models (21-23).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">The pathogenic role of IL-23 was also confirmed by the phenotype of IL-23p19 transgenic mice, in which premature death, systemic inflammation, anemia, and elevated serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins were observed (22).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.52">In human disease, the mRNA levels of both IL-23p19 and IL-12p40 were shown to be increased in skin lesions of psoriatic patients (24), <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">suggesting</ccue> that elevated IL-23 contributed to the pathogenesis of psoriasis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.53">Therefore, IL-23 began to attract attention as a factor crucial to inflammation and autoimmune

id="S1.55">While it was becoming clear that IL-23 was the culprit in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">question remained</ccue>, how was it acting?</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.56">Another inflammatory cytokine, IL-17, was noted to be produced by activated purified T cells in the presence of LPS-stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) (5).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.57">It was also found that IL-23 promoted IL-17 production from memory T cells and this production was suppressed by treatment with anti-IL-12p40 antibody (5).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.58">Now IL-17 is recognized as the founding member of a family of proinflammatory cytokines: IL-17 (IL-17A), IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E (known as IL-25), and IL-17F (6).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.59">IL-17A and IL-17F induce the production of various proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF- α), IL-1ß, and IL-6, and CXC chemokines from monocytes, airway epithelial cells, vein endothelial cells, and fibroblasts to mount defense against extracellular bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumonia, Bacteroides fragilis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (6, 25, 26).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.60">These responses result in the recruitment, activation and migration of neutrophils to the sites of inflammation and infection (6).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.61">CD4+ T cells are major producers of IL-17, but in addition CD8+ T cells, neutrophils, γδ T cells, and invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells also produce this cytokine (26-28).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.62">Various reports associated IL-23 with IL-17 production with the onset or exacerbation of inflammation (20-23, 29).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.63">For instance, IL-23p19-deficient mice showed reduced incidence of CIA, with fewer IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells (20).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.64">Consistent with this report, treatment with anti-IL-23p19 antibody reduced serum levels of IL-17 and inhibited development of EAE (29).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.65">Moreover, IL-23 was found to be essential for production of IL-17 and IL-6 in colitis mouse models (22, 23).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.66">Regardless of exactly how IL-23 works, these reports supported the <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">idea</ccue> that an IL-23/IL-17 axis, but not IL-12/IFN-γ axis, was a crucial pathway in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases (21, 30).</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="SectionTitle"><Sentence id="S1.67">Regulation of Th17 differentiation</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="Text"><Sentence id="S1.68">Although many results linked IL-23 with IL-17 production in CD4+ T cells, less was known about how Th17 cells arose from naive CD4+ T cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.69">It was very clear that development of IL-17-producing T cells was not dependent on the cytokines and the transcription factors required for Th1 or Th2 differentiation and then it was <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">proposed</ccue> that IL-17-producing CD4+ T cells represented a new subset of helper T cells (Th17 cells), which were crucial in mediating inflammatory responses (30-32).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.70">While there was evidence that IL-23 stimulated CD4+ T cells to express various genes, including IL-17, and that IL-23-stimulated T cells were important in the pathogenesis of EAE (30), it was less clear <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> IL-23 was the factor that drove naive CD4+ T cells to become IL-17 producers.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.71">It was especially puzzling that naive CD4+ T cells did not express IL-23R (18).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.72">In a search for optinum culture condition for Th17 differentiation it was recognized that naive CD4+ T cells cultured with activated DCs produced IL-17 (16).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.73">It was then recognized that the combination of IL-6 and transforming growth factor ß-1 (TGFß-1), with appropriate stimulation of TCR, were the optinum stimuli inducing Th17 differentiation (Fig. 1a) (16).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.74">Accordingly, TGFß-1-deficient mice showed impaired Th17 development, whereas addition of TGFß-1 rescued the number of Th17 cells (7, 33).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.75">Thus it became clear that IL-23 was not the direct initiator of Th17 production (16), but rather was an important factor for expanding and maintaining

id="S1.24">As UDP-GlcNAc is synthesized de novo from glucose via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, glucose flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway increases O-GlcNAcylation of proteins.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">Furthermore, compounds like glucosamine (GlcN), streptozotocin, O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucopyranosylidene)amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc), and

O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to modulate (i) enzyme activity, (ii) protein-protein interactions, (iii) DNA-binding affinity, (iv) subcellular localization, and (v) the half-life and proteolytic processing of proteins (81).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">Furthermore, O-GlcNAcylation often plays an antagonistic role in relation to phosphorylation (36).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">The

functions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Furthermore, O-GlcNAc plays a pivotal role in the regulation of gene expression via modification of RNA polymerase II (12, 39) and associated transcription factors (31, 32).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">Thus, O-GlcNAc serves as a nutrient sensor to couple the metabolic status to cellular processes, such as protein degradation, signal transduction, and gene transcription.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Some of the transcription factors involved in HIV-1 gene regulation are modified by O-GlcNAc, including AP-1 (67), yin-yang 1 (YY1) (28), NFATc1

belongs to the Sp1-like/Krüppel-like family of transcription factors characterized by three C-terminal Cys2His2 zinc finger motifs (34) and a DNA-binding affinity to GC-rich sites (16).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">Two decades ago, Tjian and coworkers showed that Sp1 bears at least eight O-GlcNAc sites and that the O-GlcNAcylated form of Sp1 was more active than the non-O-GlcNAcylated protein (31).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">In the meantime, other studies revealed that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> also result in a reduction of transcriptional activation (62, 77), <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">indicating</ccue> that the specific effect of O-GlcNAcylation on Sp1 activity strongly depends on the

(29).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.343">This directed us to <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">investigate</ccue> the impact of the monosaccharidic metabolite O-GlcNAc on HIV-1 gene expression.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.344">We showed that increased O-GlcNAc levels inhibit HIV-1 transcription in human T-cell lines as well as in human primary CD4+ T lymphocytes.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.345">This effect <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">appeared</ccue> to be mediated by the transcription factor Sp1, as supported by several lines of experimental evidence.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.346">First, we demonstrated that O- GlcNAc-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 transcription required the presence of Sp1-binding sites in the HIV-1 LTR promoter.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.347">The Sp1-binding sites are well conserved throughout the lentiviral HIV-1 LTRs (18), and mutation of one or more Sp1-binding sites in the basal HIV-1 LTR promoter leads to a strong delay in replication in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in T-cell lines (45, 58).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.348">This is also reflected in our observations that mutation of the Sp1-binding sites decreases HIV-1 LTR activity in transiently and stably transfected cells.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.349">But although Sp1-mutated HIV-1 LTR activity was still measurable and inducible, no significant O-GlcNAc-mediated inhibition of promoter activity was observed.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.350">Second, the presence of the Sp1 protein was crucial for the inhibitory effect of O-GlcNAc on the HIV-1 LTR.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.351">Inhibition of Sp1 expression with siRNA completely abolished OGT-mediated inhibition of HIV-1 LTR activity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.352">Interestingly, although Sp1 is implicated in the activation of a large number of genes, depletion of the ubiquitous transcription factor did not induce cytotoxicity.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.353">This is in agreement with the observation of Philipsen and coworkers, who disrupted the mouse Sp1 gene and found that Sp1-deficient embryonic stem cells were viable and showed normal growth characteristics (50).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.354">This <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue> be attributed to the compensation of Sp1-triggered gene transcription by other Sp family members, such as Sp3, which is also ubiquitously expressed and has the potential to activate transcription of certain otherwise Sp1-regulated promoters (70).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.355">Third, Sp1 was found to be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT, and this decreased its ability to activate the HIV-1 LTR promoter.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.356">These findings are in accordance with the results of Kudlow and colleagues, who showed that O-GlcNAcylation decreases the capability of Sp1 to activate GC-box-containing promoters (77).</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.357">But it has to be emphasized that O-GlcNAcylation of Sp1 does not generally inhibit transcription.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.358">We have shown here that the human EF1α promoter, which
