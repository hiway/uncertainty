id="S1.1">The killing of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a gynecologist in Buffalo who performed abortions, has become a factor in at least two campaigns in New York, say political consultants and some campaign advisers.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.2">In the race for attorney general, the Democratic candidate, Eliot Spitzer, who favors abortion rights, has moved quickly to make the anti-abortion position of his opponent, Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a central issue in the campaign.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.3">And in the tight race for U.S. Senate, while the Democrat, Charles Schumer, another abortion-rights supporter, has  not   raised  Slepian's death himself, his aides say it puts a new emphasis on the issue.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.4">Slepian was shot in the back on Friday night as he stood in his kitchen.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.5">No   suspects  have been identified.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">Even before the killing, Schumer was tyring to draw more attention to the anti-abortion record of his opponent, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican who is also running on the Right to Life Party line.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.7">In a New York Times/CBS News poll completed on Saturday, 69 percent of those polled said they did  not   know  D'Amato's position on abortion, and only 19 percent knew that he opposed abortion rights.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.8">Now events are doing the work for Schumer.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.9">Slepian's death was among the first topics raised in Saturday night's debate between the two men, and it was instantly followed by a question to D'Amato on <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> he  opposed  first-trimester abortions for adult women.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.10">On Tuesday, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League plans to hold a news conference to screen a television advertisement   featuring Emily Lyons, a nurse who was badly wounded earlier this year in the bombing of an abortion clinic in Alabama.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.11">The advertisement, said Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York State affiliate of Naral, is intended to spotlight D'Amato's vote against the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which Schumer sponsored.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.12">The measure made it a Federal crime to attack or blockade an abortion clinic.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.13">Now, Ms. Conlin said, it will have new resonance, and the organization is considering buying more air time.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.14">``It's incredibly sincere and powerful and it would have been regardless,'' she said.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">``But sensitivities are so heightened from the shooting in western New York that it's even more powerful.''</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">David Eichenbaum, a Democratic political consultant who is  not   working  for anyone in this year's campaign, said abortion ``is  no longer  the driving  issue  it once was, at least on the pro-choice side.''</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">But, Eichenbaum said: ``Sometimes an incident like this will do more to energize those who are pro-choice who otherwise <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue>  not   consider  that as an important an issue to go to the polls over.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">It brings it home.''</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">D'Amato's aides would  not   comment  about the political ramifications of the slaying, and Schumer's aides would  not   talk  about <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> they  planned  to refer to it in any advertisements, or <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> the candidate  planned  to use it on the campaign trail.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.20">``Both Senator D'Amato and Chuck Schumer agree this was a horrific crime and a horrible tragedy,'' said Josh Isay, Schumer's campaign manager.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">But, Isay added, ``it heightens the abortion issue.''</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Steven Goldstein, the campaign spokesman for Spitzer, was less reticent.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.23">``Eliot is going to make a huge priority of this,'' Goldstein said.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.24">``Stopping clinic violence is going to be a major theme of our campaign from now to Election Day.''</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">In Sunday's debate against Vacco, Spitzer attacked him for  failing  to  enforce  a court order in 1992 against anti-abortion protesters who had blocked the entrance to a clinic.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">It was the same clinic where Slepian worked.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">A federal judge removed Vacco, then the U.S. attorney for western New York, from the case.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.28">He was replaced with two special prosecutors.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.29">Spitzer also criticized Vacco for dismantling the Office of Reproductive Rights, which investigated threats and crimes against abortion clinics, when he became attorney general.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">On Monday, Spitzer called for Vacco to revive that unit immediately, vowing that he would do so on his first day in office if elected.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">Goldstein, who said it was ``thoroughly, thoroughly <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue>'' that the issue would  surface  in Spitzer's advertisements, defended the use of the issue by noting that the attorney general has direct impact on the issue of clinic access.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">Vacco's campaign manager, Matt Behrmann, said in a statement that Spitzer had ``sunk to a new and despicable low by attempting to capitalize on the murder of a physician in order to garner votes.''</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">``It's <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possible</ccue> that New York politics has  never   seen  anything as crass as Eliot Spitzer's willingness to exploit the unfortunate murder of Slepian as a steppingstone for his own political ambitions,'' Berhrmann said.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">Several consultants agreed that there <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue>  be  political hay to be  made  in Slepian's death but that it had to be done carefully.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">``Trying to score political points from a homicide <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">can</ccue> have a  backlash ,'' said Maureen Connelly, a media consultant  not   working  for any candidate in next week's election.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="unknown"/></Document><Document type="unknown"><DocID

experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $58.6 million from $186.4 million a year ago, when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">The company said its

its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to solve the Arab world's most frustrating problem, the 23-year Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians.</Sentence></DocumentPart><DocumentPart type="unknown"><Sentence id="S1.4">Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease his isolation, though, the international pressure against him clicked up another notch.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.5">The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq, allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.6">Secretary of State James Baker, speaking on ABC News' "This Week," said the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries "a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.7">The U.S. maintains that under the U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the collective enforcement of international sanctions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.8">Mr. Baker  declined  to  use  the word blockade, but said that "interdiction" of Iraqi shipments would begin " almost instantly."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.9">In a statement, the White House said it would do "whatever is necessary" to ensure compliance with the sanctions.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.10">Other Bush administration officials said that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and Australian ships -- <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue> be  used  both to  stop  oil exports from leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to  stop  shipments of food and other goods from going

food.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.12">The president responded, "Everything, everything."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.13">While  shying  away from actually  using  the word "blockade," Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.14">"No point getting into all these semantics," he said.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.15">"The main thing is to stop the oil from coming out of there."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.16">The naval interdiction force is part of an overall American strategy that officials say is designed to leave the Iraqi leader with only the stark choice of backing out of Kuwait or launching new attacks to change his situation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.17">Though they insist they are  n't   trying  to lure Saddam Hussein into an attack, officials hope that <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">if</ccue> he  strikes  again, the U.S. and its allies <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">will</ccue>  have  such an impressive force in place in Saudi Arabia that they will be able to crush him in retaliation.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.18">Iraq's first option, of course, <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">may</ccue>  be  simply to  sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.19">Speaking on the ABC program, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue>  plunge  the U.S.

that its neighbors eventually will help it survive a prolonged war of economic attrition with the West.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.21">So Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.22">Then yesterday, he tried to entice Arab leaders with his proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of Kuwait with Israel's occupation of the West Bank.</Sentence><Sentence

"categorically " rejects the proposals.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.25">And President Bush yesterday, asked <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> he was at least  glad  Iraq is discussing negotiations, replied: "I do  n't   see  anything to be  pleasing  in there at all."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.26">American strategists are  calculating  , though, that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">perhaps</ccue>  undeclared  naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.27">At that point,  rather than   go  through the humiliation of  backing  out of Kuwait, the Iraqis <ccue

much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia, hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve his bargaining position.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.30">But that  option  is growing less and less <ccue type="speculation_modal_possible_">likely</ccue> as thousands of American, British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.31">The Saudis even have in their possession 48 Kuwaiti jet fighters, virtually the entire Kuwaiti air force, which managed to escape the Iraqi invasion, Saudi officials said.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.32">The Saudi "window of vulnerability . . . is closing very fast," Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, said over the weekend.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.33">The second possibility <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">would</ccue> be to   start  a  fight  with Israel, in hopes that all Arabs <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">would</ccue>  have  to move behind Iraq in a fight against their common Israeli enemy.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.34">In such an event, Saddam Hussein also <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue>  calculate , the Saudis <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">would</ccue> be  under  pressure to kick out U.S. troops because of America's close ties with Israel.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.35">Iraq <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue>  start   hostilities  with Israel either through a direct  attack  or by  attacking  Jordan.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.36">Israel has publicly declared that it will respond to an Iraqi attack on Jordan because it wo  n't   allow  Iraq's dangerous army to  take  control of Jordan's long border with Israel.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.37">Iraq's third attack option <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">would</ccue> be to   start  an undeclared  war  on the U.S. and other Western nations through terrorism.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.38">Two Middle East terrorists with records of successful attacks against Western targets, Abu Nidal and Abu Abbas, have ties to Baghdad.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.39">And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.40">And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.41">They are  n't  being  allowed  to leave and <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">could</ccue>  become  hostages.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.42"><ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">If</ccue> Iraq  chooses  a simple war of nerves and economic attrition, the Bush administration knows a long stalemate <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">could</ccue>  try  the patience of the American public and the West in general, and <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">could</ccue> open the <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">possibility</ccue> that moderate Arabs -- even including Saudi Arabia -- <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">might</ccue>  drop  out of the effort against Iraq and  accept  some deal from Saddam Hussein.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.43">But U.S. officials have sized up Saddam

id="S1.44">"This is a guy who is impulsive, and therefore capable of big miscalculations," says one senior administration official involved in managing the crisis.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.45">The official  adds , though, that "at the same time, we <ccue type="speculation_hypo_doxastic _">think</ccue> he is someone who is  capable  of rational judgments when it comes to power.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.46">And when he finds something is unprofitable, then one can see certain accommodations."</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.47">Thus, administration aides will be trying to calculate <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> Saddam Hussein's proposed diplomatic formula for getting out of Kuwait  represents  the first sign he is searching for a way out or simply is a public relations  stunt .</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.48">There are disagreements among experts about how much pressure will be needed to make Saddam Hussein decide he's up against the wall and <ccue type="speculation_hypo_investigation _">whether</ccue> simple economic pressure will ever be  enough .</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.49">The biggest <ccue type="speculation_modal_possible_">worry</ccue> is that <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">if</ccue> he  decides  he needs a way out of his predicament but does  n't   see  a face-saving method, he <ccue type="speculation_hypo_condition _">could</ccue> lash  out in dangerous and unpredictable ways.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.50">U.S. officials claim they already see signs Saddam Hussein is getting nervous.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.51">In the first days after President Bush announced the dispatching of U.S. troops, they note, the Iraqi leader made several nationwide addresses indirectly -- having them read by a television announcer.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.52">"That shows he's nervous about pinpointing his location, either because he's afraid we'll find him, or that internal enemies will," says one U.S. official.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.53">The unpredictability of Iraq's leader is a principal reason the U.S. is going to such great lengths to build a mammoth force in and around Saudi Arabia.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.54">Pentagon officials say the goal is to put 40,000 troops in the region by the end of the month.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.55">But the administration is  n't   putting  any upper limit on how high the force could go after that, calculating that it <ccue type="speculation_modal_probable_">would</ccue> be a  mistake  to underestimate and an advantage to keep Saddam Hussein guessing.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.56">U.S. commanders in charge of planning for Middle East crises have indicated in the past that they were capable of deploying as many as 300,000 troops.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.57">And the U.S. is taking similar steps to ensure that its naval force is adequate to carry out a blockade of Iraq and support a war if necessary.</Sentence><Sentence id="S1.58">Over the weekend, Pentagon officials confirmed reports that a fourth U.S. aircraft carrier -- the John F.
